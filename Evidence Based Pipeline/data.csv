Jadeja said that formation of the supervisory authority will be done while framing the Rules for the amended Act. President Ram Nath Kovind has given his assent to a Bill passed by the Gujarat Assembly last year, which made some important amendments to The Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property and Provisions of Tenants from Eviction from Premises in Disturbed Areas Act, a controversial law that is popularly known as the ‘Disturbed Areas Act’. * The amended Act enables the state government to form an advisory committee that will advise it on various aspects of the DA Act, including adding new areas to the ‘disturbed areas’ list. Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja has said that the advisory committee will be formed after the Rules of the Act are framed. The DA Act is applicable in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Himmatnagar, Godhra, Kapadvanj and Bharuch. * A provision has been made for the creation of a special investigation team (SIT) or committee to probe these aspects. In municipal corporation areas, the SIT will comprise the concerned Collector, Municipal Commissioner, and Police Commissioner as members. In areas other than municipal corporations, the SIT will have the Collector, Superintendent of Police, and Regional Municipal Commissioner as members. * As per the government, earlier only those areas which had witnessed (communal) riots would be notified as ‘disturbed areas’. However, now, the government can notify any area as ‘disturbed area’ where it sees the possibility of a communal riot, or where it sees the possibility of a particular community’s polarisation. In Vadodara, two cases of property transfers in a single area have been challenged in the Gujarat High Court. Which are the areas where the DA Act is currently applicable in Gujarat? What are the penal provisions for violation in the amended Act? Under the Disturbed Areas Act, a district Collector can notify a particular area of a city or town as a “disturbed area”. This notification is generally done based on the history of communal riots in the area. * To check the registration of transfer of properties in disturbed areas without the Collector’s prior approval, the amended Act has a provision to enlarge the scope of the term ‘transfer’, and include transfer of right, title or interest in or over such property in disturbed areas by way of sale, gift, exchange, and lease. To achieve this goal, the Act has amended the Registration Act under which no property in disturbed areas can be registered without prior sanction of the Collector. In April 2018, Nagrik Sewa Samiti, an Ahmedabad-based outfit which is part of the Hindu Jagran Manch – affiliated to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) – filed a complaint seeking the reclamation of a housing society called Varsha Flats. It said the residential society in Ahmedabad was allegedly ‘taken over by Muslims’. “Just like love jihad, Muslims practice something called land jihad,” said Jigar Upadhyay, one of the founders of the Samiti and a member of the Hindu Jagran Manch. Following the complaint by the Nagrik Sewa Samiti, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani ordered a review of Disturbed Areas Act with the intention of plugging its loopholes. The meeting was attended by Pradipsinh Jadeja, Minister of State for Home and officials of the home and revenue departments. Provision for the creation of an SIT or a committee to probe these aspects has been included in the amended Act. The Act now enables the state government to form an advisory board who will advise the government on adding new areas to the list. The amended Act enhanced the scope of the term ‘transfer’ to include transfer of right, title or interest in or over properties in disturbed areas by means of sale, gift, exchange and lease. Under the amended Act, no property in disturbed areas can be registered without prior sanction from the collector. “There was no clarity about the inclusion of Varsha Flats in the Disturbed Areas Act, so we were initially given permission and documents were registered by the district sub-registrar. Later, the authorities realised the flat does fall under the Act and then permissions were granted under the Disturbed Areas Act. Thereafter, two men named Apoorv Shashtri and Jigar Upadhyay identified themselves as social workers and raised an objection. These two men are in no way related to the property or stay near it. Yet they were heard by every authority including the Chief Minister. They kept accusing us of land jihad and distributed pamphlets around Paldi asking people to wake up and save Paldi from becoming Juhapura (a Muslim ghetto in the city),” said Ruknuddin Sheikh, one of the builders. Under the Act, a district collector can notify a particular area of a city as a ‘disturbed area’. Once the area is declared as such, the transfer of immovable property in the disturbed areas can take place only after it gets the collector’s nod on an application by the seller and the buyer. In the application, the seller has to attach an affidavit declaring that he/she is selling the property of his/her own accord at a fair market price. A person can be imprisoned and fined for violating the Act. In July 2019, the Gujarat government moved to amend the Act, claiming that a large number of complaints had been received by ruling party MLAs about people who had flouted the provisions of the Act by using legal loopholes. The amendment received Presidential assent on October 13, 2020. The BJP government claimed that the aim of the Act is to check polarisation in the state. Currently, 109 areas in Ahmedabad district are declared ‘disturbed’ under the Disturbed Areas Act, with new areas added in June this year. In August this year, areas under four police stations in Vadodara were said to be ‘disturbed’ under the Act after a representation on the matter by local BJP MLA Manishaben Vakil. In May this year, areas under two police stations in Surat were added to the Act due to a long-standing demand by local BJP MLAs of the areas. The Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property and Provisions of Tenants from Eviction from Premises in Disturbed Areas Act, commonly known as the Disturbed Areas Act, was enacted in the year 1986. It was meant to be temporary in order to prevent the distress sale of properties following the riots in 1985-86. However, it was replaced with a new act in 1991, which empowered the Gujarat government to declare a riot-prone or communally sensitive area as ‘disturbed’.

The BJP also informed that Union Home Minister Amit Shah will visit North Bengal to hold an organisational meeting of the party before Durga Puja. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi will connect with the people of Bengal virtually on October 22. He will address the people on the auspicious occasion and will be with them in spirit to celebrate the puja,” said Vijayvargiya. This year Durga Puja is beginning on October 22 and ending on October 26. On Amit Shah’s visit, the BJP leader said, “The Union Home minister will come to North Bengal for a party meeting. He is trying to come before Durga Puja. However, the dates have not been finalised yet.” Assembly elections in the state will be held next year. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced that she will virtually inaugurate Durga Pujas this year to avoid crowding. This time Durga Puja will be held amid covid 19 restrictions and the Mamata Banerjee government has issued strict guidelines for puja committees to follow in a bid to contain the spread of covid infection. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually addressed the people of West Bengal on the occasion of Durga Puja and asserted that the Centre’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India) would be strengthened from Bengal. Beginning his address, PM Modi shared his puja greetings in Bengali and appealed to the people to adhere to social distancing norms and wear face masks while taking part in the festivities. PM Modi also spoke about women empowerment and said women in the country must be given the respect people give to Goddess Durga. The event was held at Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) in Salt Lake, where a Durga Puja is organised by the BJP. Party leaders Kailash Vijayvargiya, Mukul Roy and Union Minister Babul Supriyo were present at the event. The address was preceded by cultural programmes and a beautiful rendition of a Rabindranath Tagore’s song by Supriyo. On Wednesday, PM Modi wished people via Twitter in Bengali. He described Durga Puja as an auspicious festival that signifies the triumph of good over evil, and in a subsequent tweet wrote that he would wish “brothers and sisters” today. “Durga Puja is an auspicious occasion, which celebrates the victory of good over evil. We pray to Maa Durga to bless us with strength, happiness, and good health,” he tweeted. Read| By organising Durga Puja, BJP tries to project ‘Bangaliana’, discard ‘Hindi heartland’ image The prime minister also paid tribute to the icons of Bengal and said that the state had always made the country proud. “Whenever the need was felt in India’s history, Bengal has always led the way for India and shown the path. If I continue to take names of such Bengalis, we will come to the end of the day, but the names shall continue,” he said. The prime minister said though Durga Puja this year was being celebrated on a limited scale due to the Covid-19pandemic, the “enthusiasm is still unlimited”. “Bengal’s Pujo gives India a new colour. We are celebrating Durga Puja in times of COVID-19, all devotees have shown exemplary restrain. The number of people might be less but the grandeur and devotion are the same. The happiness and joy are still boundless. This is the real Bengal. There is such power in the devotion there, that it seems that I am not in Delhi but today I am present among you all in Bengal,” Modi said. Noting that Goddess Durga was worshipped as a symbol of ‘Shakti’ (strength), Modi said his government wasconsistently working for the empowerment of women. “From opening Jan Dhan accounts for 22 crore women, giving soft loans to them under the Mudra Yojana, to launching Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao initiative, granting permanent commission to women in the armed forces and extending maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks, we have taken a number of steps for their empowerment,” he said. READ | Assam artist creates Durga idol using medical waste Modi had addressed party workers virtually, opening his speech in Bangla and wearing Bengali dhoti-kurta, before inaugurating a Durga Puja organised by the party at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre at Salt Lake. The puja included a cultural programme, with performances from celebrities. Kunal Ghosh, Trinamool’s state general secretary, also rubbished the BJP’s claims on Trinamool taking over the Durga Puja celebrations. Last year, six months before the assembly elections, the BJP had celebrated Durga Sasthi with fanfare, coining slogans like ‘No Durga Puja without Kamal (lotus, the party’s symbol)’ and having representation in several puja organising committees in the capital city as well as other districts. Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP’s national general secretary in-charge of Bengal, said leaders are deliberately avoiding active involvement in the Durga Puja for the sake of their karyakartas. Senior BJP leaders claim the Trinamool has “converted Durga Puja into a party event”, and that’s the reason their own celebrations are muted. But the ruling party’s leaders hit back at this claim, saying the BJP never understood Bengal’s Durga Puja and its culture — that its fervor for the festival was just a way to satisfy its “vested electoral interest”. The BJP has organised the EZCC puja this year too, and it was inaugurated by newly appointed Bengal unit chief and MP Sukanta Majumdar. But outside of that, the party hardly has any representation in puja committees, and what’s more, many of the leaders who had filled these roles last year, such as former Trinamool leaders Sabyasachi Dutta and Mukul Roy, have returned to Mamata Banerjee’s camp. “They are vote pakhi (seasonal birds who only come when they want votes). Their Hindutva and their love for Maa Durga, all are political and for votes. Last year, they had some organisers and clubs, but now all of them are back to the Trinamool fold. So what will they do? They will accuse Trinamool, just for optics,” he added. Also read: How Durga images and sculptures showed up in Ghazni, Afghanistan “People of Bengal have seen Maa Durga in Didi (Mamata Banerjee). She has protected them from the fascist force called BJP. They trust Didi more than anyone. So, they are calling her to inaugurate their pujas. Why did BJP fail to build such a connection with the people? Where is their top leader? I assume he (Modi) does not have time for Bengal and Bengalis now,” Ghosh claimed. Responding to the BJP leaders’ allegations and claims, Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy said the BJP failed to understand Durga Puja, and the sentiments attached to it by Bengalis. The BJP’s poll preparation on the ground began over two years ago. Realising that West Bengal would be no mean task, the party assigned senior leaders like Kailash Vijayvargiya, Shiv Prakash and Arvind Menon to the state. Apart from state chief Dilip Ghosh and other Bengal leaders, these BJP members travelled across the state to strengthen the organisation. The polarisation factors on which the BJP thrives were presented to them on a platter, said Abdul Matin, another analyst. During the campaign for the 2021 election, PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah addressed multiple rallies in the state. MPs Swapan Dasgupta and Locket Chatterjee were fielded as candidates, as were some other senior leaders who were expected to give the TMC a strong fight in its strongholds. Yesteryear’s dancing superstar Mithun Chakraborty was brought in for a last-leg push. This, according to political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty, was the beginning of the rise of saffron forces in the state. The episode found mention in each of Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s political rallies in Bengal over the past four years. CM Mamata Banerjee, however, seemed to have caught on to this and sought to counter the allegations by emphasising her Hindu identity on more than one occasion during the campaign. The BJP is believed to have started getting a foothold in the state after the Mamata Banerjee government took a decision to restrict Durga idol immersion for a day in 2017 to allow processions for Muharram, which coincided with Durga Puja that year. “The BJP got entry into Bengal because Mamata Banerjee prepared the ground for them by announcing financial assistance for Muslim clerics, by prioritising Muharram over idol immersion and sheltering criminals, who happened to be Muslims. This is how the divide was created and the BJP flourished on that,” he added. Another factor often cited in discussions about the BJP’s rise in Bengal is Mamata Banerjee’s alleged Muslim appeasement. The strides the BJP has made in the state can be attributed to the support it gets from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has consistently built on its presence in the state since 1939. By Poulomi Saha: The BJP on Sunday unveiled its manifesto for the 2021 West Bengal assembly elections. Called 'Sonar Bangla Sankalp Patra 2021', the manifesto was released at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) in Kolkata by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya and state party chief Dilip Ghosh. We are committed to fulfilling the aspirations of our people of West Bengal. @BJP4Bengal’s Sankalp Patra is our resolve to build Sonar Bangla. Watch my address at the launch of #SonarBanglaSonkolpoPotro. https://t.co/yVTt48nCMc— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) March 21, 2021 Dilip Ghosh said the manifesto came together over the last month when BJP's ‘Lokkho Sonar Bangla’ raths and vehicles travelled across Bengal and collected people's suggestions. Amit Shah in West Bengal : During his two-day visit, the Union Home Minister will be meeting BJP’s state leaders, review poll preparations, look into organisational matters, and also discuss the party’s strategy for the upcoming Assembly polls. Kolkata (West Bengal): Union Home Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Amit Shah arrived in Kolkata for a two-day visit to the state. Ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections in West Bengal, Shah has arrived in the state to take stock of the party’s organisational matters. Union Home Minister Amit Shah held a review meeting with senior officials of CRPF in Bankura, West Bengal, today: Office of the Home Minister “Vote for good governance, development and prosperity…”: Amit Shah as polling begins in Karnataka Met with the family of our martyred Booth Vice President Madan Ghorai in Kolkata.

Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over several issues. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar at the Durga Puja, conducted by the party at EZCC in Salt Lake, on Saturday. “We have been told to organise post-Puja events at all mandals of the party to rebuild the organisation. But if our leaders can’t declare a truce among themselves even during the festivities, how do they expect unity at the grassroots?” asked a state BJP office-bearer. While state BJP president Sukanta Majumdar visited the Puja once on the day of the inauguration on Saturday, leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari and the party’s national vice-president Dilip Ghosh gave the event a miss. By the next year’s Puja, Ghosh had been replaced by Majumdar, yet the newly appointed national vice-president of the party made it a point to visit the Puja at the EZCC in Salt Lake. Adhikari was not a BJP member when the Puja was first organised by the BJP. The Puja was conceived by the then BJP minder for the state, Kailash Vijayvargiya, and Ghosh publicly opposed the idea. However, that didn’t stop Ghosh from participating in the event. Given her post as a general secretary of the state BJP, she was expected to be highly engaged in the Puja. Sources close to Chatterjee said she was unhappy with the fact that two other general secretaries were getting more importance in the decision-making process. A mandal is the smallest organisational unit of the BJP. The BJP had already declared that the party would no longer hold Durga Puja after this year. Asked about his absence from Puja, Dilip Ghosh said he had been touring other districts on Friday and Saturday. On Sunday, he left Calcutta for Uttarakhand and will come back to the city on October 9. Suvendu Adhikari did not take calls from this newspaper. The Durga Puja organised by the Bengal unit of the BJP this year remained a lacklustre event as the top tier of the state leadership largely stayed away from the final edition of the festival held by the party. However, in 2021, he was already a BJP MLA and the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. The Nandigram MLA not only participated in the Puja but was also seen playing dhaak, along with Majumdar.This time, a number of MPs and MLAs also gave the Puja a miss. “We are trying to project our ‘bangaliana’ face. Durga Puja has its own emotions when it comes to Bengalis. Therefore, our Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished the people of Bengal, and in Bengali language of course. This will also prove that we are desperate to win the state elections,” a senior party leader said in front of the pandal. Former Salt Lake mayor and the man who organised the puja, Sabyasachi Dutta, said, “Anyone can worship Durga. Just the date has to be right. There is no obstacle to worship.” The imprint of Bangaliana is also apparent in the cultural events that have been planned. One of the main events was the “Mahishasuramardini” dance by Dona Ganguly, the wife of BCCI chief and former Indian Men’s cricket captain Sourav Ganguly. When the PM started his speech, the BJP leaders at the event welcomed him with the traditional Bengali ululation. In an attempt to shed its tag of a Hindi heartland party, and project “Bangaliana”, or Bengaliness, the state BJP on Thursday celebrated Durga Puja, its first ever, at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) in Kolkata’s Salt Lake area. On Thursday, senior BJP leaders such as Vijayvargiya, Locket Chatterjee, Supriyo, Debasree Chowdhury, and Raju Banerjee went on to the stage in the middle of a programme and started playing the “dhak [traditional drum]“ and conch shells. The pandal’s main decorator, Raja Banik, said the order to build the marquee was received only on October 15. “All things are made with traditional Bengali art and culture. The idol is draped with traditional ‘Daker Saaj’,” he added. A senior leader of BJP said, “If you want to become the ruling party of Bengal, you have to first be Bengali. Then you should have a cultured personality. We are now trying to prove both, because we are now close to coming to power in Bengal.” “Moreover, there are instances that indicate his alignment. He is seen as close to (Home Minister) Amit Shah (whose son is BCCI secretary). During PM Modi’s address before Durga Puja, his wife Dona Ganguly (a noted Odissi dancer) performed in the programme,” he added. Kolkata: BCCI president and former Indian cricket team caption Sourav Ganguly triggered much speculation in poll-bound West Bengal Sunday as he met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at Raj Bhavan in Kolkata. Had  interaction with ‘Dada’ @SGanguly99 President @BCCI at Raj Bhawan today at 4.30 PM on varied issues. “We cannot rule out the possibility of Sourav Ganguly joining the BJP. There has been an effort by BJP leaders to rope in Dada as an acclaimed Bengali face,” said Prof Biswanath Chakraborti, a Kolkata-based political analyst. The Trinamool Congress, however, claimed it was confident that Ganguly is not joining the BJP. “Sourav Ganguly is a Bengali icon. He met the governor today. We do not expect any political discussion there,” said Trinamool MP Saugata Roy. “We know that there has been an attempt to make the project the election as a ‘Didi vs Dada’ fight, but we think Sourav Ganguly is prudent enough to not fall in the trap laid by the BJP. It is just a matter of optics,” he added. Now that his cricketing career is over, don’t be surprised if Ganguly, like his colleague Srisanth joins the ruling party of the day viz. the BJP.  The people of Kerala wisely threw out Srisanth and I think the same fate awaits Ganguly in Bengal. And deservedly so. Accepted his offer for a visit to Eden Gardens, oldest cricket ground in the country established in 1864. pic.twitter.com/tB3Rtb4ZD6 The visit comes months ahead of a crucial assembly election where the BJP is looking to score its maiden victory in the state. While even the Trinamool Congress has denied that Sunday’s meeting is likely to have had any political significance, political analysts said the timing suggested otherwise. The timing of the meeting triggers speculation, said Prof Partha Pratim Biswas, another analyst. “Raj Bhavan is called the BJP’s state headquarters by the Trinamool. In fact, the governor is not perceived as an apolitical person here. If Ganguly had to make a courtesy call, why didn’t he do that in so many months ? Why now?”"

Two states - Maharashtra and Kerala - accounted for more than half of the country's total Covid-19 cases, joint secretary (MoHFW) Lav Agarwal said on Friday. Out of the two, Kerala reported the most number of new Covid-19 cases in a single day - 13,772. ALSO READ: Why Kerala continues to account for over 30% of India's daily Covid tally On Kerala’s Covid-19 management, Pinarayi Vijayan said that more than 60 to 70 per cent of Covid hospital beds have never been used. Additionally, about 90 per cent of the total patients are being treated free of cost in government hospitals. The chief minister also pointed out that the state government has controlled the cost of treatment in other private hospitals as well. Talking about the Covid surge in Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan said that the second wave of pandemic hit the state in May, a little later than compared to other states. At one point the case positivity rate rose to 29 per cent. The number of patients per day was over forty thousand. Later, the positivity rate dropped to around 10 per cent and has now remained largely unchanged over the last few days, the chief minister said. Going by numbers alone, Kerala looks to be in a good place. Daily reports of fresh positive cases are down to the single digits, with most of those restricted to the two northern Kerala hotspot districts of Kasaragod and Kannur.Recoveries are more than active cases; and only two deaths have been reported thus far (three, if you count the unfortunate passing away of a man from Mahe – a tiny union territory enclave in north Kerala). In an ageing state like Kerala, with a significant percentage of senior citizens – the very demographic quotient most susceptible to the Wuhan virus – Vijayan’s unilateral move must not become a matter of life and death – not even by a miniscule probability. This is an important question, but one which Vijayan would be hard pressed to answer. Reason being that, in spite of ‘testing, testing, testing’, which is supposed to be the panacea to the whole epidemic issue as per some quarters, the so-called ‘Kerala model’ has conducted only 19,351 tests in a population of over 33 million thus far (data as on evening of 19 April).

Invest as low as 10,000 and earn better returns than FD The Pinarayi Vijayan-led State government had been under fire from Opposition parties and some public health experts for allegedly eliminating many COVID-19 deaths from its official numbers. But the government insisted that Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines were being followed and refuted the charges. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. Many experts, say reports, felt that the testing strategy in Kerala had been designed to reduce the number of deaths. Patients who tested positive and had moderate symptoms or were asymptomatic were not tested again before they were discharged. But for critical patients, there was a repeat of the antigen test to ascertain whether they had turned negative. Also, read: Kerala’s COVID-19 management is a model for other states, here's why It was during the NDA government’s period that about 12% of those in the Below Poverty Line category improved their living and reached the Above Poverty Line category, he recalled. Quoting the latest figures of the National Crime Records Bureau, he pointed out that Kerala was witnessing a strange growth in its crime rates under the rule of the LDF government which was upholding only pseudo-secularism. For example, the LDF has a lead in gram panchayat seats over UDF in 10 of the 14 districts, spreading across the state. If we look at block panchayat figures, here too, the LDF has a lead over the UDF in 10 of the 14 districts. In municipalities, the UDF has done slightly better, winning control of 45 of the 86 municipalities followed by the LDF getting power in 35 and NDA in two. One of the key markers of the LDF's success has been its ability to bring in precious allies, the chief among which is the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K Mani. Using the influence of KC(M) among farmers and Catholic voters, the CPM has won 15 of the 22 district panchayat divisions and 9 of the 11 block divisions in Kottayam. Going by the victory processions of the LDF, UDF and the BJP in various places across the state, it doesn't seem as though we are in the middle of a pandemic, especially in a state contributing one of the highest number of cases every day. In corporations, the LDF achieved simple majority in Kozhikode, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram and became the single largest party in Kochi. The UDF got a simple majority in Kannur and the single largest party status in Thrissur. In Both Kochi and Thrissur, both fronts will have to shore up support of rebels or Independents to get mayor and deputy mayor posts. ""LDF has strengthened. It's popular voter-base has expanded. More people have supported the LDF than ever before. That's chiefly because Kerala's mindset has allied with the protection of secularism."" LDF’s major inroads into UDF vote-banks particularly in Thrissur, Ernakulam and Kottayam districts indicates a popular support base that goes beyond the CPM’s strict cadre votes. This election has demonstrated the strength and influence of the Jose K Mani-led Kerala Congress(M), especially in the central Kerala districts of Kottayam, Idukki and Pathanamthitta. In 2015, the CPM-led Left Democratic Front made a splash in the polls winning a larger number of panchayats, block panchayats and corporations than the prime challenger -- Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). But when it came to municipalities, the UDF had a slight edge. In the 14 district panchayats, both fronts shared power of seven district panchayats each. Of the 1,199 local government bodies in Kerala, the LDF either won a majority or is the leading political bloc in 670. The LDF is followed by the United Democratic Front, led by the centrist Indian National Congress (INC), which leads or has a majority in 471 local bodies. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was only able to secure a victory or is leading in 25 local bodies, which is only marginally better than its performance in the previous local election in 2015. There has been some marginal but noticeable rise of the BJP, especially in urban and semi-urban local bodies. It maintained its control over the Palakkad municipality, which it had gained in the previous election in 2015. The right-wing party also gained an outright majority in the municipality of Pandalam. Nonetheless, Kerala has remained one of the few Indian states which continue to resist the rise of the right-wing BJP. The LDF made significant gains in several key local bodies. For instance, LDF gained 51 seats in the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram, winning a majority. It also emerged as the largest political bloc in the municipality of Kochi, Kerala’s financial and trading hub, breaking UDF’s decade-long dominance in the city. Since 2016, Kerala has dealt with two massive incidents of flooding, an outbreak of the Nipah virus, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach of the government has won great praise in the country and abroad. The highlight of this disaster management strategy has been a community-centered approach. In the case of COVID-19, Kerala was the first to record a case in India but managed to keep the number of cases very low in the first wave. Later, as the number of cases rose due to multiple rounds of internal worker migration, a very strong contact tracing strategy and community involvement ensured that the death rate was very low. This is despite the fact that the proportion of elderly people in Kerala is higher than the all-India figures. The electoral victory for LDF is a huge morale boost for left and progressive forces here. Elections for the state government will be held in a few months. Over the past four decades, rule at the state level has alternated between the LDF and the UDF. The LDF came back to power in 2016, with senior communist leader Pinarayi Vijayan becoming the chief minister. THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, India—The Communist-led coalition in the India state of Kerala has swept the local elections that were held between Dec. 8 and 14. In results announced Wednesday, Dec. 16, the Left Democratic Front (LDF), led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which is in power in the state, achieved a substantial lead in rural and urban areas. The numbers show the coalition overcame a negative campaign by the media and opportunistic alliances among its adversaries. Observers have attributed the victory to the Communist government’s effective community-based strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the focus on development and economic assistance programs. LDF candidates K.J. Maxy and K.N. Unnikrishnan have run up a lead of 9499 and 7216 votes respectively while UDF candidate K. Babu has a slender lead of 635 in Tripunithura. Of those leading, Minister for Electricity M.M. Mani has the highest lead of over 20,000 votes in Udumbanchola in Idukki district (as of 11 a.m.). Other Ministers leading are CM Pinarayi Vijayan in Dharmadom constituency in Kannur district, Health Minister K. K. Shyalaja in Mattannur, Minister for LSG A. C. Moideen in Kunnamkulam,  Minister for Excise T. P. Ramakrishnan in Perambara, Minister for Devaswom Kadakampally Surendran in Kazhakuttom, Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran in Elathur, Minister for Ports Kadanappally Ramachandran in Kannur and K. Krishnankutty in Chitoor. In Malampuzha, LDF's A. Prabhakaran is leading by around 2,000 votes over NDA's C. Krishnakumar, and in Mannarkkad, UDF candidate N. Shamsuddin is leading by nearly 1,700 votes over LDF's K.P. Suresh Raj. Sachin Dev had showed an advantage in the constituency much before the polls, especially since it is the sitting seat of Purushan Kadalundi of CPI-M, who had won rthe constituency in 2011 at a margin of 9,882 votes. He had increased the margin to 15,464 votes in 2016. Sachin Dev has outdone both feats to retain the constituency this time. The party had strong roots in the constituency known for its socialist lineage. When Mr. Sreedharan had got his lead mainly from Palakkad Municipality, where the BJP is in power, Mr. Shafi began to make gains when the counting moved over to neighbouring panchayats. The confidence factor of the UDF during its high-volt campaign in Koduvally was the lead it gained in the recent local body elections. The Koduvally municipality and the other six grama panchayats had stood by the UDF, which was then claimed to be a clear indicator of their victory. Kerala Chief Minister and LDF candidate Pinarayi Vijayan is leading with a slim margin in Dharmadom constituency in Kannur, according to initial reports. As the counting entered the last phase, Mr. Kunnamparambil had a lead of nearly 1,000 votes over Mr. Jaleel. LDF candidate K.P. Kunhammad Kutty has relished success in Kuttiyadi assembly constituency with a thin victory margin of 333 votes against sitting MLA and UDF candidate Parakkal Abdulla. Mr. Kunhammad Kutty won 80,143 votes after a close fight with the sitting MLA. Mr. Kunhammad who secured 79810 votes. Mr. Sreedharan is leading by over 1,500 votes in the initial round of counting."

Today, President Biden will announce additional efforts to get Americans their updated COVID-19 vaccine, so that they have the protection they need heading into Thanksgiving and can have a safe and healthy holiday season. Over 20 million Americans, including nearly one in five seniors, have already rolled up their sleeves to get their updated COVID-19 vaccine, and the President will encourage more Americans to do so right away. The President will get his updated COVID-19 vaccine, and call on everyone—including state, local, education, and business leaders—to do their part to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities.While COVID-19 is not the disruptive force it was when the President took office, the virus continues to evolve. COVID-19, flu, and other respiratory illnesses spread more quickly in the winter, as people gather indoors. As the weather gets colder, Americans must take action to stay protected.We have the tools we need to manage this moment. The updated vaccines target the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron – the versions of the virus that are most dominant in the U.S. and around the world. For most Americans, if they get this updated COVID-19 vaccine, they can go about their lives this fall and winter with the peace of mind that they remain protected against serious illness. And, if they do get sick, there are widely available and easily accessible treatments that reduce the severity of illness, keep people out of the hospital, and save lives. President Biden to Call on All Americans to Get Their Free, Updated COVID-19 Vaccine and Do Their Part to Ensure a Safe and Healthy Winter We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

We have an exciting line-up of events starting November and going on all the way till February. These events and IPs will offer unique opportunities for brands to reach out to targeted audiences and create mass awareness about their brand or product, create experience zones to induce interest and finally generate lead for conversions,” said Neeraj Saraswat. The radio industry has come a long way since the pandemic. The festive season of 2022, which started with Ganesh Chaturthi and will go on till Dussehra and Diwali, is expected to fuel this recovery. Given the scenario, we spoke to industry experts to understand the industry better, especially the growth of the regional markets. Neeraj Saraswat, CRO, Fever FM, too asserts that they are optimistic about returning to pre-Covid levels this year. “With several innovative products being launched, the channel is looking at continuous engagement with its audiences,” he says. Talking about the factors that is driving growth this season, Namjoshi shared that the festive season adds up to 25-30% of revenue for all major categories. “People are at ease and looking forward to an exciting festive season after a hiatus of two years owing to Covid restrictions.” One of the major constraints is music rights, which we only have for FM transmission, and that requires some amount of work so that we are also able to offer a live radio on the main FM radio through a digital medium. So, I think that's an area where we'll be working to try and see if we expand the reach. Also, a lot of it is getting addressed by the government and we are optimistic that by the time you're ready for the next round of auctions a lot of the earlier bottlenecks will be cleared. We’re on our way to having a much better, more robust kind of industry. Experts explain why regional radio is the next big target for brands and advertisers in the coming years After a two-year lull, the radio industry is finally hoping to witness a stronger festive period this season. While the business is yet to recover fully from Covid and reach the pre-pandemic levels of revenue, experts are optimistic that this year will be good for the industry as the sector is already exhibiting significant signs of strong recovery. Nihalani shared that the rise in consumer spending is one of the biggest factors driving growth during this festive season. Consumers are back in full swing after two years of subdued festivities, and hence, brands are actively deploying strategies to connect with and cater to them. Since radio is hyperlocal, it will always be used to advertise for retail education, real estate FMCG and public services. We also see retail, lifestyle, events, real estate and education bouncing back from the pandemic as we witness the volume growing and revenue improving month on month. Also, during the festive period, all key advertisers and segments will utilise the medium's ability as it helps in fraternising with all other mediums as a multiplier for reach and frequency.” The Director-General launched the #WearAMask challenge on social media to help spread the word about how and when to use a mask to protect against COVID-19. This campaign, involving a wide range of partners, is part of WHO’s wider call to take a comprehensive “ do it all” response to the pandemic. WHO held a Member State briefing to provide more information about the outbreak. In his opening remarks at the 1 May media briefing on COVID-19, the Director-General spoke about the EC's advice for WHO and outlined how the organization would continue to lead and coordinate the global response to the pandemic, in collaboration with countries and partners. WHO finalised its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP), centred on improving capacity to detect, prepare and respond to the outbreak. The SPRP translated what had been learned about the virus at that stage into strategic action to guide the development of national and regional operational plans. Its content is structured around how to rapidly establish international coordination, scale up country preparedness and response operations, and accelerate research and innovation. WHO's first infodemiology conference began, as part of the organization’s work on new evidence-based measures and practices to prevent, detect and respond to mis- and disinformation. 'Infodemiology' is the science of managing ‘infodemics’: the overabundance of information – some accurate and some not – occurring during an epidemic. The WHO-China Joint Mission began its work. As part of the mission to assess the seriousness of this new disease; its transmission dynamics; and the nature and impact of China’s control measures, teams made field visits to Beijing, Guangdong, Sichuan and Wuhan. WHO partnered with musician Kim Sledge and social impact enterprise The World We Want to  launch the #WeAreFamily campaign to inspire global solidarity for better health. Part of the proceeds from a special edition cover of the 'We Are Family' song will be donated to the WHO Foundation. Based on lessons learned from the H1N1 and Ebola outbreaks, WHO finalised guidelines for organizers of mass gatherings, in light of COVID-19. The WHO Director-General announced the co-chairs of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR) to evaluate the world’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This announcement was a response to the request in a landmark resolution adopted by the World Health Assembly in May, which called on WHO to initiate an independent and comprehensive evaluation of the lessons learned from the international health response to COVID-19. The WHO Foundation was established, with the aim of supporting global public health needs by providing funds to WHO and trusted partners. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO Foundation will initially focus on emergencies and pandemic response. By facilitating contributions from the general public, individual major donors and corporate partners, the Foundation will drive work towards securing more sustainable and predictable funding for WHO, drawn from a broader donor base. HHS is also launching a public education campaign with TV and digital ads that will be played during the World Cup, the White House said, with a specific focus “on reaching adults 50+ for Black, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI), American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) and rural audiences.” Additionally, there will be a “targeted paid media effort” to urge Americans over 50 years old and those with chronic conditions to “seek treatment right away if they get Covid-19.” That ad will run in 46 television markets nationwide, the White House said, plus on social and digital media. “With winter and holiday gatherings right around the corner, more Americans getting their updated vaccine will help avoid thousands of preventable Covid-19 deaths. The six-week campaign will focus on reaching seniors and the communities that were hardest hit by Covid-19 through making it more convenient to get vaccinated and increasing awareness through paid media,” a fact sheet shared first with CNN said. The Biden administration is launching a critical, six-week push aimed at stepping up Americans’ Covid-19 booster vaccinations heading into the holiday season. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will announce new enforcement guidance Tuesday “to ensure nursing homes are offering updated Covid-19 vaccines and timely treatment to their residents and staff” that will warn nursing homes with low vaccination rates “will be referred to state survey agencies for close scrutiny” and could “face enforcement actions.” Biden’s chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, kicks off the campaign during Tuesday’s White House press briefing, which will likely be his last appearance from the briefing room podium ahead of his expected December retirement. Fauci, who has served under seven US presidents and became a household name in the early days of the pandemic, will detail the urgency of getting vaccinated as public health officials have expressed concern about the confluence of Covid-19, RSV and the flu this season."

New Delhi: The present security scenario along our northern frontiers is at an uneasy “no war no peace” status, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Tuesday, referring to the prolonged border row with China in eastern Ladakh. Asserting that India's sovereignty and territorial integrity would not be compromised under any circumstances, the minister said, “Strengthening our defence is aimed at achieving international peace and stability and we do not want to take any step that will endanger international peace. We have the same expectation of our neighbours and other countries of the world.” “There are security challenges on the northern border, but the intentions of the military are as strong as it can be,” Singh said at the Rafale induction ceremony at Ambala Air Station, without naming China. The Indian Army has clearly stated to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) that “shifting” of the Line of Actual Control is not acceptable to it, the sources said adding Chinese military is now desperately attempting to give “ex post facto strategic meaning” to its actions in eastern Ladakh.

Clearly, he was not going to let his desire to capture the farming sector and please his corporate supporters and funders get the better of his desire to win a third term in office, but many other factors were at play as well and in the post-announcement, the media did a creditable job of trying to unearth what these may be. Suffice it to say that the rock-like stance of Narendra Modi conveyed through innumerable public meetings and television addresses that these “farm reforms will give farmers new markets, access to technology and help bring investments in agriculture that will benefit them”, stood shattered. An independent media may have found it in themselves to condemn the tone and tenor of this statement made in the context of a struggle of millions of farmers and peasants for a fair deal but went far beyond by targeting social activists who came out in large numbers in support of these protests. But the media did not do this. So how do journalists “retrench from technology”? Hope has some suggestions, including the simple stratagem of leaving the phone behind while meeting important sources. He also adds that media organisations must become more involved in protecting their journalists in terms of the technology they use. As he puts it, “It is critical how organisations buy their equipment.” They could, for instance, two simple non-smartphones and provide their newsrooms with technology kits that secure them against surveillance, especially when sensitive investigations are being conducted. Hope’s words come as a timely reminder that the trusty companion, our mobile phone, may not be so trustworthy, after all. The old way of carrying it wherever we go needs to be seriously reviewed. “Hypothetically speaking, what would have happened if Aryan Khan was just another common man. Would he have still been languishing in jail for the rest of his life like many others still languishing in prison without any legal help? Crowding prisons with undertrials have taken a big toll on the government’s exchequer. As the legislative head of state in Maharashtra, we request you to suo motu seize the matter of undertrials, investigate/inquire and give deserving undertrials and their families the gift of freedom, which cannot be the monopoly of the family of Aryan Khan alone.” Readers occasionally write to us with story suggestions. Nitin Vishen, a regular reader of The Wire, writes in: “I have come to know that several National Institutes of Technology (NITs) have received a letter from the Ministry of Higher Education to admit a bunch of 75-100 students irrespective of their rank in JEE-Mains. If this information is true, such bypassing of the admission process to our premier institutes can undermine their reputation and credibility. I do not have the resources to investigate and report this. I request you to please look into this, and please report if you find this information is true. So Hope’s observation that the time has come for journalists to “retrench from technology”, is extremely relevant. In other words, while they would need to get the best out of existing information technology, by allowing themselves to be accessible to their sources, they must make sure that they themselves work below the government’s radar, especially when undertaking sensitive investigations. As Hope puts it, the Pegasus matter is a “pertinent wake up call for journalism because never before have we been so vulnerable. The way this technology has become a powerful tool, you are leaving all the trails that you are trying to lose.” I confess, I have little idea and would be really interested if someone could answer this question for me. My hunch is that as news organisations try and tighten their budgets given declining revenues, they are cutting back on even the basic security measures that existed earlier such as transportation for late-night drops back home. Given this, it is even less likely that news organisations in India are in any hurry to draft policies to protect their staff, despite the recent spate of assaults on media personnel. That ‘Big Media’ is disappointed in this development is best captured in the raft of editorials in the country’s leading newspapers. All of them are basically premised on the neo-liberal argument that the marketisation of the agriculture sector that the farm laws engendered is good for the country and its farmers although there were mild disagreements over the manner in which the prime minister sought to push them through. “Narendra Modi does not usually back off when confronted with difficult political challenges, but he has done so this time. Whether this will reduce him to a lameduck for the remaining half of his second term or not remains to be seen, but there is little doubt that his political capital has shrunk.” 'Please Don't Keep Him In Jail, He Will Break': Chat Between Wankhede And SRK Surfaces In Aryan Khan Case Services Row: Delhi LG Writes To CM Kejriwal Over 'Intimidation, Disregard Of Rules' By AAP Govt Tarot Card Reading for Today; May 17: Leo can Expect Help, Pisces will Have to Careful About Their Health BJP leaders have said that the agitation could “dent the BJP’s image as a farmer-friendly party”, something that it cannot afford. The government, sources said, has instructed I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar to see that the “right message is conveyed”. Another farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chadoni said that they will have to take more steps if the government does not fulfil their demands. ""Will block other roads of Delhi if govt does not withdraw new three farm laws, say leaders of protesting farmers at press conference,"" he added. Kejriwal also said that Singh had several chances to stop farm bills but did not do so. In Monday’s discussions among ministers, it was decided that Tomar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh would get in touch with the leaders of the protesting farmers. Farmer leaders of the BJP too, would try to initiate talks with those leaders of the protesters who may be willing to engage with the government. “The idea is to get them to start talking, because some of them are adamant that there should be no talks unless the laws are withdrawn,” a source said. ""The reason behind Captain sahab's allegation is that we did not allow the nine stadiums in Delhi to be converted into jails. Centre had plans to put the farmers in these stadiums. They're upset with me as I didn't give permission for making them jails,"" he added. “Earlier, decisions of the government were opposed, now there is a new trend… Rumours have become the basis for opposition. Propaganda is spread that although the decision is right, it can lead to other consequences, about things that haven't happened or will never happen. It’s a game that is deliberately played by those who have fooled the farmers for decades,” Modi said. ""We appeal to the farmers to suspend the protests and come for the talks. However, this decision depends on farmers' unions and farmers,"" he added. On the frontline of protests against three farm laws are farmers who have availed the minimum support price (MSP) during the ongoing kharif marketing season but now fear whether MSP-based procurement will continue in coming years. While there is no mention of MSP in the law, protesting farmers say that once APMC mandis weaken after the implementation of new laws, MSP-based procurement, which is in place since decades, will also end. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday asked the government to wake up and shed ""arrogance"" to provide protesting farmers their rights. ""The food grower is sitting in protest on the roads and fields and speeches are being given on TV. We all are indebted to the hard work of farmers. This debt will be over only by giving them justice and their rights, and not by mistreating them or by beating them with batons or using tear gas against them,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi. ""Wake up and come down from the chair of arrogance and think of giving the farmers their rights,"" he also said. The Shiromani Akali Dal on Tuesday blamed the Centre for the failure of talks with farmer leaders, saying it was deliberately prolonging the negotiation process with the aim of tiring out the farmers. The SAD, which had quit the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance over the new farm legislation in September, cautioned the farmers' organisations against alleged ""conspiracies to trap them with misleading and vague commitments through tricks like setting up a committee"". Setting up a committee is merely a part of delaying tactics to tire the farmers out, the party alleged in a release here. ""The BJP is trying to create divisions in the organisations and may have unleashed agents to accomplish this task. Farmers must be vigilant against such dangerous moves and stay united under all circumstances. Their success depends on their unity and on their success depends on the future of our country,"" it said. PTI “No prime minister in this country wanted to be remembered as anti-farmer and that must have been one of the major considerations of Modi in finally succumbing to the pressure of the farmers. Second, Modi must have assessed that things in the border state of Punjab were turning delicate due to the farmers’ protest. No prime minister could afford to face another trouble in the backyard when problems in Kashmir valley will be prolonged for years to come due to the decision of the BJP government to read down Article 370,” Yogendra Yadav said. At that stage, there was an opportunity for the Modi government to end this protest by revoking these laws but it had something else in mind. “It was not without a reason that the Modi government started thinking of revoking the laws as the SKM began hitting them politically,” he added. Farm economist Sucha Singh Gill told The Wire that the first defining moment of the protest was when Punjab farmers’ unions realised that holding protest alone in Punjab would not serve their purpose as they needed to involve farmer leaders of other states in order to pressurise the Union government in withdrawing these farm Bills. He added, “Finally, I think BJP’s internal opinion polls in UP finally forced Modi to announce the repeal of the farm laws. In this decision, the Lakhimpur Kheri incident had a huge role to play. This blatant episode earned them such bad publicity at all-India level that they had to defend themselves at all costs.” “We had to fight hard to bring the movement back on track. We were fighting at multiple levels. First, it was important to provide adequate security to SKM leaders since their lives were at risk. Second, we had to stop anti-social elements from causing further damage to the protest. Third, we had to stop farmers from going back to their homes by making regular appeals day and night. At the end, we somehow managed and revived our protest,” he said. He also said that the role of the media during the farmers’ movement played an important role and should be discussed. He said the entire mainstream media had ganged up against the movement and ran such shameful stories that it will go into the textbook of journalism on how not to do journalism. Balbir Singh Rajewal, another key leader, said that SKM had no intention to campaign against the BJP in the Bengal elections. “We were forced to take extreme steps because of the negative attitude of the BJP government against our demands,” he said. When negotiations did not proceed further, the farmers announced a major mobilisation programme in the shape of a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26 to put further pressure on the Union government. This was the next major phase of the farmers’ protest that forced SKM and other farmers’ unions to change their strategy to convince the Union government to listen to their demands. Even as the Modi government made several offers to make suitable amendments to the farm laws, farmers’ unions stayed firm in their demands to repeal the farm laws. As citizens of India, we can only express our sorrow at things happening. The question however is how long will the people in power protect the cronies? How long will the manu-stream media continue to play the role of the biggest villain of our democracy? We must share our own blame for not supporting the right people and those who are trying to bring facts and analysis to us. The time is ripe for people to support all the alternative forms of media which stand for people and their rights. If we do not support such initiatives, we will ourselves have to blame for the crisis after Morbi, nothing would happen to the party as it will continue to win ‘trust’ of people in Gujarat. The country needs to be saved from such cynicism but that is only possible if intellectuals too come out of their safety zones and speak up and support independent alternative media which can expose the attempt by the cronies to create the narrative of the alternative against the BJP by promoting Arvind Kejriwal who has clearly shown where does he stand and what are his priorities. K’taka: Former BJP MLA gives veiled threat to Muslims for not voting for him While Modi was busy ‘electioneering’ in Gujarat, it was the Manu-stream media that started building up another narrative. The shameless and thuggish ‘experts’ wanted people ‘not to politicise’ the issue. They did not have the courage to demand that the prime minister stop his political campaigns using public funds (in Gujarat) but they continued to ask questions to people. A well-known anchor on ‘prime time’ actually blamed the people themselves for the collapse of the bridge. This is the man who dishes out ample ‘wisdom’ to people on his prime-time programmes with a one-point agenda: to defame opponents of the prime minister and defend his most indefensible actions. If. we don’t wake up sooner than later we will realise all liberals, seculars media will be jumping on this conclusion as the corporate want everything in its hand. It would not allow India go back to those who commit to secularism-social justice and welfare state. Unravelling Hindu Personal Law, how far has the reform gone towards a more just framework for women? Now, one can understand just what kind of people have been promoted by the BJP’s crony-ism and why action has not been taken against this criminal who violated all the laws to open the bridge when it was not ready. Punjab: Farmers Block Rail Track, say Compensation for Land Acquisition Inadequate Media and politicians both are speaking the language of their cronies who are funding them and it is reflected very much in the crisis that has happened in Delhi which is the most polluted city of India. All standards of clean air (minus pollution) have gone haywire in Delhi. It is a regular feature after Diwali but the media and the government put the blame on the stubble burning by Punjab farmers. Kejriwal used to accuse the Punjab government in the earlier times but right now he is doing nothing. His ministers blame farmers but shamelessly don’t tell people that fire crackers, unmindful construction work and vehicular traffic are the real cause. In the last few years corporate sponsored politicians as well as media have kept the blame of the Delhi’s pollution on farmers alone so that the criminal cronies are saved and continue to fund these parties. Is this decay of Gujarati society responsible for the fact that political parties refuse to stand with Zakia Jaffari who is genuinely fighting to get justice? Why is it that Gujarat needs a Muslim villain to protect its ‘identity? The Aam Admi Party which, in Punjab and Delhi, claimed to be following the path of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar is functioning in opposition to the ideologies of the two legends. ""The residents are a bit apprehensive about the lack of complete trial in case of Covaxin and might not participate in huge numbers thus defeating the purpose of vaccination.

Sharpening his attack on the Centre over the farmers'' protest, Mathur said, ""Even Lord Ram will not be able to save them. They have incurred the curse of farmers.” The CM urged the public to refrain from giving negative comments about the vaccine without valid scientific proof as it may create suspicion and hesitation in people’s mind.

He said the Modi government will have to bear the consequences of insensitivity towards farmers. “They have been speaking about doubling the income of farmers but now it seems they are acting at the behest of the capitalists,"" Mathur said.

Expressing her dissatisfaction over the ""inadequate number of Covid-19 vaccines"" supplied to West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said her government ""strongly feels"" that all people of the state should be inoculated free of cost. ""This disease kept people away from their families. The mothers cried for their children and had to stay away. People could not meet their elderly admitted at hospitals.

I believe he would have won, breaking the barrier of religion also. People vote for their caste when they don’t see any option. When people have the option to compare, they will always vote for the best. Chief Minister of Delhi, our Prime Minister and also Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar have, to an extent, managed to break the caste barrier in recent elections,” said Barriarr. Candidates of a particular party can be elected to the Upper House based on their party’s strength in the State Legislative Assembly. Voting is by single transferable vote which means electors can vote for any number of candidates in order of their preference. A candidate requires a specified number of first preference votes to win and each vote has a value of 100. The contest in Rajasthan is set to be tricky as both the Congress and the BJP have fielded candidates beyond their legislative strength In the Rajasthan Assembly. While Congress is well placed to secure two wins as it has a majority of 108 seats in the 200-member Legislative Assembly, where one candidate requires 41 first preference votes to win, It has announced the names of three candidates— the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, and members Mukul Wasnik and Pramod Tiwari. Considering their strength in the State Assembly, UP’s ruling BJP-led NDA was expected to get eight members elected to the Upper House. It has a strength of 273 MLAs in the State Legislative Assembly, while the SP-RLD-Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party alliance was hoping for the victory of three candidates with a total of 125 MLAs in the State. The number of first preference votes required for a single MP varies in each State based on the size of the Legislative Assembly and the number of seats for which elections are taking place. For instance, one candidate requires at least 42 votes or a value of 4,200 to get elected from Maharashtra, is 36 in Andhra Pradesh, 45 in Karnataka, 76 in Madhya Pradesh, and so on. Each candidate requires 45 first preference votes to win from the State. The BJP, with 119 MLAs, has enough votes to win two seats but has fielded a third candidate. The saffron party’s candidates — Kannada actor Jaggesh, Ms. Sitharaman, and MLC Lahar Singh Siroya have filed their nominations. The Congress too, with the requisite numbers for just one win, has picked two candidates — senior leader Jairam Ramesh and minority leader Mansoor Ali. The move by both parties to field extra candidates was triggered by the Janata Dal (Secular) fielding its candidate Kupendra Reddy, despite not having the numbers to secure even one berth. Meanwhile, the BJP, with 71 seats in the Assembly, has the strength set to secure one Upper House berth but has backed an additional candidate. It has picked former State unit chief and party veteran Ghanshyam Tiwari and backed media baron Subhash Chandra, who is running as an independent. The fate of the fourth candidate will depend on who the independents and other parties in the Assembly lend their support. While there are 13 Independents, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) has three seats, the CPI(M) and the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) two each, and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has one. Utpal has claimed his heart continues to be with the BJP but he was contesting to ensure a ""wrong person"", possibly a reference to the serious cases registered against Monserratte in the past, does not get elected from a seat his father represented for several terms.

In an attempt to cash in on the prestige of veteran leaders and convert it into the gain of seats in Uttarakhand, major political parties like the BJP and the Congress have once again given priority to political families over their common workers. Though the BJP often targets the Congress over ""dynastic politics"", both the parties have expressed their trust only in the close relatives of the leaders in more than 20 per cent of the total assembly constituencies of the state.

HMS Hermes, now called INS Viraat, is pictured on September 28 heading to the breakers' yard in Alang, Gujarat, to be broken up for scrap But now the veteran aircraft carrier HMS Hermes has reached her final destination – the breakers' yard. Likewise, schemes to make her a museum or a sunken diving centre came to nothing, and a crowdfunding bid to bring her home to England failed. By 1966, there were complaints that Hermes was outmoded, and she was almost sold to the Australian navy. Held at port in Mumbai since then, she has now been sold off for scrap and will be taken to Alang where she will likely be turned into motorcycles. She was then returned to Mumbai for an official decommissioning ceremony before her weapons and combat systems were stripped out. She has sat idle at the port since then. Indian sailors remove the flag from the Hermes - then known as INS Viraat - in 2017, as she was officially decommissioned in Mumbai before being sold for scrap Held at port in Mumbai since the, she has now been sold off for scrap and will be taken to Alang where she will likely be turned into motorcycles. The Viraat completed her last voyage under her own steam in 2016, when she sailed from Mumbai to Kochi, where her engines were stripped out. For the last voyage, a ship’s ultimate owner sells the vessel to a company that specializes in scrapping ships, which registers it to an FOC, and sails the ship to a beach in South Asia. This was precisely the scenario with the Cecilie, the Clara, the Thomas and the Claes. Flagging ships for their final voyages to the scrapping yards of South Asia is a practice that ultimately causes significant harm in the communities where those scrapping yards are located. In 2014, the Global Spirit, a Japanese-owned ship flagged to Panama that was in a Belgian port at the time, appeared to NGO Shipbreaking Platform to have been sold for scrapping. The organization alerted Belgian authorities. They forbade the Global Spirit from leaving Belgian waters until its owners agreed to recycle it in an approved facility. The International Chamber of Shipping, a trade organization, objected. The chamber argued that the waste shipment regulation was intended for toxic cargo, not the ships, therefore the regulation did not apply. Whether lawmakers intended it or not, the text of the law and the fact that ships contain toxic waste make this argument irrelevant at best. Belgium’s ultimatum stood. By requiring EU-registered ships to be dismantled safely in an EU-approved facility, the SRR is meant to bolster the older, and ineffectual, waste shipment regulation. But if a company registers a ship outside the European Union just prior to dismantling — a process that’s cheap and easy — it can evade the ship recycling regulation. In her own words, Maggie Lord tells of lovingly creating an orchard haven, only to see it burn. Leaning on the levers of finance is one way to bring an end to unsafe shipbreaking. In 2018, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund — Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, also known as the Oil Fund — decided to divest from four companies that sell their ships for dismantling in South Asia. The country’s largest pension fund, Kommunal Landspensjonskasse, or KLP, soon followed suit. Withholding capital from shipping companies because of their recycling practices, some advocates believe, could lead them to change. Lenders and insurers could also require in their agreements with ship owners that they properly recycle their assets. Chief Dsta’hyl says he was acting as an enforcement officer for the Likhts’amisyu Clan when he seized construction equipment. “Why did Maersk bring the ships to Dubai?” asks Ingvild Jenssen, executive director of NGO Shipbreaking Platform, a Belgium-based non-profit that monitors the disposal of ships worldwide and advocates for sustainable ship recycling. It’s a question that vexes Jenssen. If a shipping company decides to dispose of a ship before it leaves the European Union, that would make the export a breach of the WSR."

On one side is story teller, on the other, listeners or the readers”, said PM Mann Ki Baat LIVE: PM Modi remembers Shaheed Veer Bhagat Singh ahead of his birth anniversary calling him paragon of courage and bravery. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said farmers and the agricultural sector were the foundations of a self-reliant India and that the country would progress only when the rural economy and farmers were strengthened. “Our agricultural sector, farmers, our villages are the basis of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India). Only if they are strengthened will the foundation of self- reliant India be strong. In the past few years, this sector has freed itself from various difficulties and broken several myths,"" Modi said. “It is said that people who are rooted to the ground can face any difficulty in life. Even during the difficult time of coronavirus, the agricultural sector and farmers are an example. Even during such difficult times, we have witnessed the strength of the agricultural community,"" Modi said. Delivering his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio address, Modi said transformative changes are being brought about in agriculture. He said people who are rooted to the ground can face any difficulty or challenge and that farmers are an example of people who have performed their duties even during the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday Modi asked BJP workers to reach out to villages and farmers and explain the benefits of the reform measures. The mention of farmers and agricultural sector in the radio programme and Modi’s decision reach out to farmers is the second such move in the last three days where the Union government has tried to tell farmers that the decisions taken by the BJP government are in favour of farmers. “Had we followed the essence of Bapu’s economic philosophy, we would never have to be working to build an Aatmanirbhar Bharat now. It would have happened much earlier. The power to sell their agricultural produce anywhere and to anyone in the country became the reason for the growth of farmers,"" said the Prime Minister. Modi further said that the economic philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi had focussed on building a self-reliant India. He added that farmers have benefitted from the decision to take reform measures in the agriculture sector and they now have the power to sell their crops to anyone and anywhere they get higher price of their produce. The Union government is facing tremendous pressure from farmers, especially in the grain producing northern states of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, where farmers have been protesting for the past two days. Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday said farmers need better infrastructure and modern technology for which reforms and investment are very important. Speaking at the 6th meeting of Governing Council of NITI Aayog, he said many commodities such as vegetable oils that India imports in large quantities can be locally produced and farm sector can become a large exporter in many products. He urged states to prepare their agro climatic regional planning strategies, which would help farmers. “Our agriculture sector is full of opportunities but still there are some truths we need to accept. We may be called a krishi pradhan desh (agriculture-based country) but despite that we import vegetable oil worth Rs 65,000-70,000 crore. We can stop this, this money can go to our farmers. Our farmer is the claimant of this money. But this can be stopped and our farmers can produce many such products not only for our country but supply to the world. But this would require us to form policies in that direction,” he said in his opening remarks at the meeting being attended by state governments. Modi said there is a need for competitive, cooperative federalism not only among states but also districts so that development remains a prime theme. He said that the agenda points for today discussions have been shortlisted keeping in top priorities of country in mind. The agenda of the meeting includes deliberations on agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing, human resource development, service delivery at grassroots level and health and nutrition. Building storage or processing capacities in in agriculture sector is very important, for which we need to promote investment, he said. “Our farmers need necessary economic support, better infrastructure, modern technology for which reforms are very important. Recently, many such reforms have been done which reduce regulation, and minimise intervention of the government,” he said. There was a time when India imported grains, but today farmers are producing enough not just for the country but also for those in need across the world, he said adding the farm sector needs to evolve in line with the requirements of the world. ""Value addition is required for our farm sector."" ""How long can the raw material be sent out of our country and finished products imported,"" he asked. ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) is not only about cutting imports but also raising our capacity, creativity and skills,"" the prime minister said. The vision, he said, is not just to make in India but make for the world. ""Today world's biggest companies are looking at India,"" he said in his 86-minute speech. ""Now along with 'Make in India', we will have to move ahead with the mantra of 'Make for World'."" He cited the example of India during the corona crisis becoming an export surplus nation in the manufacturing of N-95 face masks, PPE kits and ventilators. Unveiling his vision of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the goal is to make India a global manufacturing hub while a Rs 110 lakh crore pipeline of national infrastructure projects is being created to boost the economy and create jobs. Modi said India has always believed that the entire world is one family. ""While we focus on economic growth and development, humanity must retain a central role in this process and our journey,"" the prime minister noted. A blueprint of a national cybersecurity policy is ready to guard the nation against cyber threats, he said without giving details. ""One of the main priorities of Aatmanirbhar Bharat is self-reliant agriculture and self-reliant farmer,"" he said highlighting the recent announcement of Rs 1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to create modern agri-infrastructure as well as the reforms that allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. Vocal for local, re-skill and up-skill campaigns will be the main pillars, he said. ""I am confident that India will realise this dream. I am confident of the abilities, confidence and potential of my fellow Indians. Once we decide to do something, we do not rest until we achieve that goal,"" the prime minister said. Nature is a pivotal part of India’s heritage, we already have traditions and practices that will help in combating climate change, Mr. Modi says. Through PLI schemes, we are becoming a manufacturing powerhouse of the world; people are coming to India to ‘Make in India’, he says. “When Our Brahmos is exported to the world who is not proud, he asks. “Continuing, he says, “Our Vande Bharat train is also in demand, and we must become energy self-sufficient.” “We bow to those who fought for freedom and laid the foundations of our independent country- Rajendra Prasad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Lohia and Nanaji Deshmukh. We shouldn’t forget to honour our Adivasi brothers and sisters who toiled for freedom - Bhagwan Birsa Munda, Siddho- Kanu Capabilities of small farmers, small industrialists & traders among others are guaranteed to a capable India, he says. We are also grateful to Mangal Pandey, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Ashafaqullah, and Ram Prasad Bismil who shook the foundations of foreign rule,” he says. “I want to thank our Constitution framers, who have given us the federal structure that provides us with a way ahead. Our ways may be different but the aim is not,” Mr. Modi says. PM Modi calls upon the private sector to play a key role in the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, saying India can make for the world. “Organic farming is also a route to Atma Nirbharta as it can bring down Fertiliser costs. Green jobs are also opening up. The space sector has seen the most progressive space policy being in place in India. I call on the private sector to provide the world with goods, which is also a part of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” he says. PM Modi speaks of ‘trishakti’ of aspirations, renaissance and world’s expectations powering India in his I-Day address. “COVID-19 has been an example of this common consciousness where citizens came together. From supporting doctors to propelling research to taking vaccines to the remotest parts, we stood together. The country’s citizens stood with ‘corona warriors’ by the gestures of banging thalis and lighting diyas,” Mr. Modi said on the 75th anniversary of Independence Day. PM Modi also pays tribute to Narayana Guru, Swami Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore among others for awakening the nation’s consciousness. “Our freedom struggle took many forms, and a form was where - Sri Narayan Guru, Aurobindo, and others raised consciousness of society,” he adds.

They also said that its implementation will dilute the learning and quality of education at the university. He said three members dissented against its implementation. The implementation of the NEP and four-year undergraduate programme were approved by the Standing Committee on Academic Matters and the Academic Council last week. The Delhi University Teachers' Association (DUTA) held an online protest on Tuesday against the implementation of the NEP. At the meeting, the de-affiliation of College of Art from Delhi University and its affiliation with the city-government run Ambedkar University was also discussed. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by our staff and is published from a syndicated feed.) A couple of years ago, a deputation was given to the mayor of KMC by the left-wing student organisations demanding an appointment to vacant posts. Even though the then mayor Sobhan Chattopadhyay had promised to recruit at that time, but a large number of vacancies in various offices in the KMC have not been filled yet. Expressing anger towards the police, the DYFI leader said, “The police are standing in front of the barricade to stop us. The police of this state have now become gangsters. We were marching, demanding immediate and speedy recruitment. We wanted to submit the memorandum. But the police did not even allow us to submit our memorandum to the corporation officials.” Meenakshi Mukherjee said from the protest site, ""They will steal our money and build their own cars and houses. And unemployed job seekers, students, and youth will sit on the streets! This will not happen day after day in West Bengal."" Vinod Gill, president, Students Federation of India Haryana unit, told NewsClick that the move should be seen in line with ongoing experiments across the state where the government is withdrawing its hand from its responsibility to provide affordable education. Pradeep Deswal, national president, INSO, reportedly said that the state government is depriving students of economically deprived sections of getting higher education through this move. Surendra Kumar, a retired professor from MDU, told NewsClick that the decision is against the letter and spirit of the New Education Policy (NEP), which recommends the government provide stable funding to educational institutions. Vikas Siwach, president, Haryana Federation of University and College Teachers Organisations (HFUCTO), told NewsClick that the move remains arbitrary and is designed to show them in poor light in future. In a major development, the Haryana government has refused to provide grants to eight state universities to run operations for the current financial year. A finance department letter to the additional chief secretary, Higher Education Department, suggests that the government has sanctioned loans worth Rs 147.75 crore to state universities. The institutions will have to bear the expenses on their own. Mahavir Jaglan, a retired professor of geography from Kurukshetra University, told NewsClick that the decision contradicts the position of the government when it asks institutions to make money and provide subsidised education to social groups like backward castes. ""The government has already withdrawn its hands from healthcare in the state and now inching towards education. The government collects education cess worth thousands of crores from people, but where does it intend to spend it if universities have to become self-financed? Second, universities came into existence through acts passed by the Haryana Assembly. They decided without getting its assent because they knew it would be vehemently opposed. This is completely arbitrary, and university teachers will oppose it tooth and nail until it is reversed."" ""Kurukshetra University and Maharshi Dayanand University have increased their fee, and students have opposed it for the previous two weeks. The schools have been asked not to enrol students in class I in primary education. Either they will be taught through Anganwadi centres or private schools, and it will be done phase wise for other classes too. Ultimately, they want to wind up their responsibility to provide education."" Political parties have also expressed their concerns over the unprecedented decision. Commenting on the issue, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that the Khattar government has chosen to sink education in debt. ""NEP asks public-funded universities to make institutional development plans, including academic and infrastructure development plans. The government will make long-term financial commitments, not ad-hoc grants. Contrary to this, here is a government violating the directives of NEP. The government has been claiming that it will implement the policy by 2025. It is a misleading political statement where the government did not do thorough work and prepare a roadmap about the policy's requirements. 2: You do not mention whether you studied in rural India or in urban in India. After all, educational facilities are less developed in rural India aren’t they? 4: You do not mention whether the choice of education in an Indian language was by necessity i.e. non-availability of English options or whether it was by choice. Stop Spreading Mis Information, get out of your urban Bubble and smell what the rest of India Speaks. None of your leaders speak English. Where do you come from? Wiped your as in the Thames? Do not give a one off anecdotal evidence that you would not yourself admit as evidence of a larger trend. You kidding me? Education should be available in the Language I feel comfortable in, not in a language you claim we all should sprechen and learn…. 3: You do not mention the stratum of society you belong to. Did you choose the local language because you could not afford education in English? The death of English in Indian ecucation is only a myth. Thank God for that. My maid is not convinced by non english education for her kids. She says – kaam kahan hain agar english nahi ayegi to? MR. VIJ here writes a substandard piece without any evidence to the fact that some how English Education will liberate our population out of Poverty. Good education would, good teachers would. Language and medium of instruction does not dictate either of those. Neil: You left out the following major contributions of Indian Science which were discussed in the Indian Science Congress: Btw for your information there has been a press release that the English medium schools will not be converted to regional language schools……. therefore it’s optional.N if you get time from your quality journalism then please go n read NEP 2020 I guess my earlier comments were not up to par. Here is my second attempt to rebut this article. English unto itself is neither a sign nor a means to education. Education in a multi lingual country should be available in a language that the individual is comfortable in. Most of these urban elite give anecdotal stories to convince you that all of India sprechens Englais. They do not. I can provide you with enough anecdotes that tell you otherwise. People with First Class Distinction that cannot get a job because they cannot speak English. Why should you require one to learn in English and Speak in English. You are the liberal folk right? You are the Sub-Altern folk are you not? You should be the ones standing for the right to learn in my mother tongue. The reason why People want their kids to learn English is not out of love for the language. It is seen as a language of opportunity. This sense is created by Journalists and Opinion writers such as Mr. Vij. I am not sure what qualifies Mr. Vij to conclude and use a really HARSH wording as the title of this article. This is typical of the English Educated Elite. The triple E’s as I call them. Somethings we do not like or understand – Ignore! The typical indian culture Parichay Yadav, the president of PUSC told NewsClick, “The circular advising the heads of department and deans to provide counselling to the students for participating in the anti-CAA rally is meaningless. In the name of counselling, the administration is threatening the students for expressing their dissent. The heads of department and research supervisors are unfortunately indulging in the shameful act. The PUSC as a show of solidarity burned the circular in front of the admin block.” Also read: Fee Hike Means Further Exclusion of Common Students from Education Also read: Govt Underspending on Education Spurs Protests Against Fee Hikes The Dean of Students Welfare issued a circular on February 18 to the head of departments to conduct ‘counselling sessions’ for participating in unauthorised rallies held in the campus on December 10 against the CAA. Condemning the circular as a move towards curbing the right to dissent, the PUSC had held a protest which was disturbed by a security guard employed in the campus. The guard, who was reportedly in an inebriated condition, tried to prevent the students from burning the circular. The sit-in protest of the PUSC continued for the 15th day as the discussions held on Monday with the committee constituted by the university administration did not yield any positive result. The committee offered no assurances on the demands raised by the students’ council forcing the students to continue their protest. The office bearers of the PUSC have also met peoples’ representatives and political leaders of the union territory to garner support for their protest in protecting the public education system. In a bizarre move, the Pondicherry University (PU) administration has issued a circular to conduct counselling session for students who had participated in a rally opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The PU Students’ Council (PUSC) burned the circular in protest which was interrupted by the security guards of the university campus. PUSC accused the administration of threatening the students for participating in the protests. “The committee members offered to reduce 20% fee only for economically backward students. Not only is the reduction unacceptable, the committee had no idea of how the beneficiary students will be selected. They informed us that funds from the University Grants Commission have drastically reduced and the fee hike is to pay the ad-hoc faculty members. The students should not be overloaded for the mess in fund allocation for public education, Yadav added. A Visva-Bharati spokesperson said Agarwal sent his resignation letter to Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty but did not cite any reason for his decision to quit. He said that Agarwal's family lives elsewhere in the state and that could be a factor. He was appointed as the registrar of the central university a few months ago.

Agarwal, who had been gheraoed in his chamber from March 1 to 3 by the agitating students, again faced their ire during an administrative meeting on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, the students continued their protests inside the university campus stating that though the authorities acceded to their demand for reopening the hostels, the facilities are not yet ready. SFI Visva-Bharati unit leader Somnath Sow told PTI that they feel sorry for the registrar who had to resign due to the hostile attitude of the top authorities towards the issues faced by students.

Roy said online teaching cannot be alternative to physical classes, and laboratory-based subjects cannot be taught through virtual mode. Noting that inoculation of students will facilitate resumption of activities on the campus, the SFI-controlled students' body said, ""It has been 539 days since closing down our campus due to the COVID-19 outbreak."""

According to police sources, field level officers across the State were alerted that the Maoists had launched a massive recruitment programme targeting youth, particularly students. Dozens of youth, including students of a law college in the southern districts, were already inducted and subjected to a systematic indoctrination of the “Marxism, Maoism and Ambedkar ideology,” a senior police officer quoting the alert told ‘The Hindu’ on Sunday. The report said a majority of casualties to security forces engaged in anti-LWE operations were caused by Improvised Explosive Devices. Besides supporting counter-IED capacity building efforts of the Central Armed Police Forces and State police, the MHA had issued a Standard Operating Procedure relating to management of explosives/IEDs/landmines in LWE affected areas. A law graduate from Thrissur, Rupesh, who was arrested by the ‘Q’ Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police on a tip-off from the Special Intelligence Branch of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh police, was allegedly involved in several cases in Kerala. The police said he headed the Maoist operations in the tri-junction area and also accused him of organising attacks on the establishments of the forest department. His wife Shyna, who was also arrested, had quit Kerala government service to join the organisation. We have migrated to a new commenting platform.

Considering its location in the tri-junction forests of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala, the Maoists considered the base as strategic to regain strongholds in the area and take forward their agenda. However, the movement weakened following the arrest of Rupesh alias Jogi who headed the Western Ghats Special Zonal Committee and his supporters at Karumathampatti near Coimbatore in 2015. In a report, the Ministry of Home Affairs while explaining the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) scenario in the country laid emphasis on better inter-State coordination since the area of operation of CPI (Maoist) was not confined to a single State but was spread over several States. The Government of India had taken many steps to improve the inter-State interactions between the bordering districts of Maoist affected States. The sources said front organisations that were directly supporting the Maoist ideology and other like-minded groups were planning to organise mass protests against the 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). While the alert gave specific input on the recruitment and training methodology, there was no mention of the involvement of leaders from other States, the sources said. Strategic victory over them calls for clarity on the role and responsibility of the central and state and governments; honest assessment of capabilities, operational philosophy, mindset, willingness, compulsions and resolve of security forces involved in anti-Naxalite operations; and a realistic timeframe to root out this menace. A national policy to end Naxalist violence has to emanate out of economic, developmental and internal security considerations. There has to be a judicious and environmentally sustainable extraction of natural resources, leaving no scope for value capture by unscrupulous elements. An integrated approach spearheaded by counter-offensive operations led by well trained, disciplined, agile and stealthy commando force of state police; expansion of road networks from the periphery to core of liberated zone constructed under security cover of central forces or even constructed by the specially raised engineering units of central forces; quick expansion of mobile communication and commercialisation of economic activities are slow but sure and irrevocable process to success. With their ideology and strategy not getting much traction, the Maoists are seemingly succeeding in their tactics. It is showing in the support and sustenance Maoists receive from the local population and their ability to mobilise their village defence forces and armed dhalams into a kind of mobile army for a virulent attack. This is the nature of mobile guerrilla warfare. Fortunately for the security forces, the so-called liberated zone is confined to about 50,000 sqkm of forested area of Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma districts of Chhattisgarh, with little spillover into adjoining Maharashtra and Odissa. (The writer is additional DGP (Planning & Coordination), Maharashtra State Police) Achieving strategic victory is no guarantee for lasting peace. Maoism is a social, economic and developmental issue manifesting as a violent internal security problem. Even the Maoists would like the state to respond from security rather than developmental perspective, as they know that only in relative poverty and severe infrastructure deficit, they have their captive support base of the population. When former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh in 2010 flagged Naxalism as the important internal security challenge, the insurgency was at its peak. In line with that assessment, the government of India reinforced security and development assistance to state governments faced with this problem. This combined effort is yielding positive results. The number of civilians and security forces killed has come down. So is the number of severely affected districts, which are no more than 30. What is catastrophic though is the sporadic high fatalities suffered by security forces in the well-planned offensive ambushes laid by Naxalites. Is this an insurmountable challenge? Analysing this menace from ideological, strategical and tactical frameworks is likely to throw some convincing answers. According to Maoist ideology, economically oppressed peasants/working class will triumph over the oppressive capitalist bourgeois class to establish a classless society. For them, the only strategy to establish a classless society is through armed revolution. The operational tactics to give shape to that strategy is protracted guerrilla warfare. It has also sought directions to the Centre for the deployment of the Army to maintain law and order in the national capital and the areas where the “communal attack on people are most ferocious"".- PTI In a tweet later, Mr. Owaisi alleged that police were colluding with mobs and said the Army should take over the violence-hit areas. He also requested the Lt. Governor to direct the police to check violence and to take action against those involved in it. Mr. Khan also issued a notice to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) of Northeast district to send more forces to the affected areas. The Chief Minister also said she was keeping a watch. Earlier in the day, the Kolkata police held a meeting and asked all personnel to remain “extremely alert”. The State witnessed violence during the anti-CAA protests in December 2019. The Registrar General of the High Court informed the judge that as per the inputs of the police officials of the concerned area, the situation is tense. “Triggering point of the Delhi violence seems to be the inciting speech of BJP4India leader Kapil Mishra.. This actually qualifies for a sedition case as it was aimed at disturbing National peace & security. Police have to arrest him & bring normalcy in Delhi,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.-PTI An order issued by the Home Department of the Delhi government said the officer is being appointed to the Delhi police post with “immediate effect"". Advocate Sneha Mukherjee, while mentioning the plea, said they are also seeking action against certain individuals who were inciting people and making hate speeches due to which violence has erupted in various areas of northeast Delhi. ”...HMOIndia @AmitShah should issue strict orders to police to act in Nation’s interest & not in the interest of few people,” Mr. Siddaramaiah tweeted. Authorities introduced new laws on military service as tensions within army surfaced, Ukrainian shelling continued, and ties with Iran deepened. Govt declared national emergency amid mounting levels of extortion. Supreme Court president 4 Nov said establishment of UN-backed International Commission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras will not be enough to curb increasing rates of violent crime if national institutions are not strengthened. Head of Council for Private Enterprise 14 Nov said extortion was “getting out of hand” and called on authorities to intervene. Head of Police Gustavo Sánchez 24 Nov released plan to tackle extortion and President Castro same day declared national security emergency, announcing measures such as border militarisation and bank controls to “eradicate extortion”. Sánchez 25 Nov said operations will initially focus on 120 neighbourhoods in capital Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, two most populous and violent cities. Govt’s heavy-handed approach to gangs continued amid eighth renewal of state of exception; further evidence of past ties between officials and gangs emerged. M23 rebel group advanced further toward North Kivu’s capital Goma, as regional efforts to cool tensions between Kinshasa and Kigali continued. Military announced new operations in Syria and Iraq. Following bomb attack, military 20 Nov began “Operation Claw Sword”, conducting airstrikes in northern Syria and Iraq against scores of alleged PKK and YPG targets (see Syria and Iraq). President Erdoğan next day signalled possible ground incursions in both countries and 28 Nov stated govt was “determined to root out the PKK” in both; threat of ground incursion in northern Syria appeared more likely than in Iraq, and could trigger displacement and fuel escalatory cycle of violence with YPG (see Syria). Retaliatory cross-border attacks from northern Syria increased: notably, rocket attack 21 Nov killed three civilians in Gaziantep province. Earlier, operations against PKK within country concentrated on rural areas of Bitlis, Tunceli and Hakkari provinces. Govt deployed troops to DR Congo as part of East African regional force amid mounting allegations that Kampala supports M23 rebels; series of attacks targeted security infrastructure. President Ndayishimiye moved to consolidate control over ruling party and engaged in intense diplomacy on security crisis in eastern DR Congo. India and Pakistan continued mutual reproaches, while security operations and militant attacks persisted in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). Military activities around island continued as China maintained frequent aerial and maritime incursions, while U.S. and Chinese presidents discussed Taiwan in first face-to-face meeting. Authorities stepped up mediation role in Ethiopia and DR Congo (DRC) conflicts, while insecurity persisted notably near Somalia border and in Rift Valley. Preparations for national dialogue moved forward, and fighting between security forces and Islamic State militants continued in Sinai Peninsula. Authorities 8 June appointed journalist and head of State Information Service Diaa Rashwan as general coordinator of President Sisi-sponsored national dialogue. Move sparked controversy among opposition forces, with coalition of seven political parties Civil Democratic Movement 10 June denouncing “unilateral” appointment, saying it does not augur well for fair and effective dialogue process. Rashwan later in month held consultations with political, economic and social actors with a view to launching formal dialogue in July. As part of appeasement efforts ahead of dialogue, authorities 13 June released group of 15 political prisoners, adding to 59 political detainees set free since late April. Imprisonment of opponents however continued: courts 5 June sentenced 17 people to jail, including some to life imprisonment for allegedly belonging to outlawed organisation Muslim Brotherhood (MB); 28 June sentenced ten people to death and over 50 others to life imprisonment for supporting or carrying out MB-led attacks against security forces between 2013 and 2015; NGO Amnesty International same day decried “grossly unfair mass trial” and urged authorities to quash death sentences. In response to recent spike in jihadist attacks in Sinai Peninsula, security forces 5 June launched operation against Islamic State-affiliated Sinai Province (SP) west of Rafah town and in Sheikh Zuweid region. Encounters between militants and security forces in Rafah area reportedly killed large number of SP operatives 9-10 June; three soldiers 13 June; one army colonel and two tribal militia fighters around 18 June; and seven SP operatives 19-20 June. Airstrikes in same area 12 June killed six SP operatives. Russian trade minister 16 June announced Moscow and Cairo agreed to switch to local currencies for future business transactions, thus bypassing obstacles created by recent sanctions on Russia. Political tensions continued as former PM Khan threatened protests and warned of country’s split if no election held, while Pakistani Taliban and military continued to clash despite “indefinite ceasefire”. Political polarisation remained at all-time high. Khan 1 June asked why military had not defended country against “foreign conspiracy” that allegedly ousted his govt and warned that without “right decisions”, army would be destroyed and Pakistan could split “into three parts” and face “civil war”; Khan same day insisted rally demanding snap elections would be held despite abrupt cancellation in May. In response, Major General Babar Iftikhar 14 June stated National Security Council had been “informed categorically in detail by [intelligence] agencies that there was no evidence of any conspiracy”. Amid declining currency value and dwindling foreign exchange reserves, govt ended fuel subsidies, leading to 29% price growth on 15 June. Govt talks with International Monetary Fund progressed toward unlocking $6bn bailout; govt 24 June received $2.3bn Chinese loan. Khan 25 June called for protests on 2 July against rising inflation and legislation clipping anti-corruption body’s powers. Threat of political violence remained high, particularly in Punjab province and Karachi city, Sindh province, ahead of 17 July by-elections; vote in 20 Punjab constituencies will determine whether Chief Minister Hamza Sharif retains post. Separate by-election in Karachi 16 June saw clashes between supporters of Barevli hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) and Pakistan Sarzameen Party (PSP), killing one and injuring ten. Violence 26 June killed two during first phase of polls in Sindh province. Meanwhile, Pakistani Taliban 2 June formally announced “indefinite ceasefire” with govt; information minister 3 June welcomed ceasefire, but Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), key partner in govt, 12 June expressed concern over exclusion of parliament and political parties in talks. Indicating lack of support among some Taliban factions, separate attacks in North Waziristan 2, 3, 12 and 18 June killed three soldiers; exchange of fire 26 June killed two soldiers and seven militants. Govt grew closer to exiting global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force’s grey list as watchdog 17 June announced govt’s compliance with all action plan items. Tensions remained high in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), where militants launched targeted attacks, notably on Hindu minority community, and clashed with security forces. J&K’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha 6 June claimed that militancy in Kashmir was in its last stage, blaming recent increase of targeted killings on Pakistan. During two-day visit to J&K, India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh 16 June said “Pakistan continuously tries to disturb peace in the country” by “bleeding India with a thousand cuts”. China 18 June blocked proposal by U.S. and India to list militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyaba’s deputy chief under UN Security Council’s ISIL (Da’esh) Al-Qaida and Sanctions Committee. In J&K, Hindus continued to be at high risk of violent attacks. Notably, militants 2 June killed Hindu employee at bank in Kulgam district, while killing three other Hindus that week; govt 3 June rejected demand of Kashmiri Pandit employees to be relocated outside Kashmir Valley until region is stable but allowed for postings to relatively safer districts under same division. Meanwhile, militant attacks and security operations continued in J&K.

Govt 14 June announced more than 300 educational institutions run by Falah-e-Aam Trust, affiliate of banned Jamaat-e-Islami, had been shut down. Govt extended joint military operation in DR Congo; authorities arrested opposition leader protesting govt’s approach to high commodity prices. Kampala and Kinshasa 1 June extended joint military operation against Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group in eastern DR Congo by two months. After M23 armed group 13 June captured Congolese town of Bunagana on Ugandan border, several Congolese MPs next day accused Kampala (and Kigali) of supporting M23, which both Uganda and Rwanda deny. Govt 14 June announced raising defence budget by nearly 15% to $1.02bn to strengthen operations in DR Congo.

Army leadership 23 June reportedly placed military on highest level of combat readiness without providing reason. During trip to north eastern Karamoja region, President Museveni 8-9 June discussed growing opposition to govt’s attempts to disarm cattle keeping groups with local leaders and security forces, proposed series of measures to curb escalatory violence, which has left nearly 400 people dead since July 2021. In state of nation address, Museveni 7 June reiterated govt’s refusal to offer tax breaks or subsidies to address high commodity prices. Authorities 6 June released, and 14 June rearrested opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was charged in May with allegedly inciting violence during protests criticising govt’s failure to cushion Ugandans from effects of price hikes. Army 4 June reportedly made incursion into South Sudan’s Eastern Equatoria state and killed South Sudanese soldier. Amid improving relations with Rwanda, Museveni 23 June arrived in Kigali to attend Commonwealth heads of govt meeting. Talks about resumption of Mexico dialogue continued, govt supporters attacked opposition leader Juan Guaidó, and President Maduro embarked on international tour to strengthen foreign relations. While U.S. govt and Venezuelan opposition continued to insist during month that resumption of suspended Mexico talks between govt and opposition was imminent, series of violent attacks against opposition leader Juan Guaidó during country tour cast doubt. Chavista militants 4 June tried to prevent Guaidó from speaking in Maracaibo municipality by throwing chairs at organisers; 11 June forced Guaidó to flee meeting in Cojedes state. U.S. Sec of State Antony Blinken 12 June and European External Action Service 15 June condemned violence. In slight easing of sanctions, U.S. State Department reportedly sent letters to European oil companies Eni and Repsol early June allowing export of sanctioned Venezuelan oil to Europe for first time in two years, in apparent move to collect billions in unpaid debt owed by govt. U.S. Treasury Department 17 June removed Carlos Malpica Flores, former national treasurer and nephew of first lady, from U.S. sanctions list. Internationally, U.S. barred Venezuela, along with Nicaragua and Cuba, from 6-10 June Americas Summit in Los Angeles, defying pressure from Mexican President López Obrador, who subsequently boycotted event. U.S. President Biden 8 June held phone conversation with opposition leader Guaidó, reaffirmed support for interim leader and need for dialogue despite not inviting him to summit. U.S. delegation 27 June visited capital Caracas in attempt to secure release of detained Americans; effort failed and delegation left country on 30 June.

In Iran, Maduro 11 June signed 20-year cooperation plan with govt. Venezuelan govt 4 June announced it would hold “counter-summit on 28-29 June” in San Cristobal city near Colombian border to reject Madrid NATO summit, which focused on Ukraine war. Meanwhile, Colombia’s President-elect Gustavo Petro 22 June spoke with Maduro about his commitment to reopen shared border, closed since 2015; Maduro reaffirmed willingness to “re-establish normalcy” at border. Skirmishes erupted along border with Kyrgyzstan, while police carried out arrests in restive Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO). Kyrgyzstan’s Border Guard Service 3 June said clashes broke out along border with Tajikistan after Tajik border guards reportedly entered Kyrgyz territory. Kyrgyz authorities same day reported unspecified number of wounded on both sides. Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards 14 June exchanged gunfire, reportedly killing one Tajik border guard. Authorities from both sides reportedly held talks, while situation along border remained tense. Police made number of arrests in GBAO following violent anti-govt protests in May. Notably, authorities 11 June said three “leaders of organised criminal groups of the city of Khorugh” had been detained, accused of murder, illegal trafficking and “the creation of a criminal community”; authorities 12 June arrested brother of fugitive opposition politician Alim Sherzamonov, wanted for allegedly organising and financing protests. Political tensions over sequencing of elections reached boiling point. Opposition parties Waddani and Justice and Welfare Party (UCID) 9 June staged demonstration in capital Hargeisa to demand presidential election be held as planned on 13 Nov before ten-year licenses of current political parties expire in Dec. Security forces used live ammunition to disperse crown, leaving several protesters injured, including one MP and one senior Waddani official, and at least a dozen arrested. EU and several European countries same day expressed concern, urged all sides to “de-escalate the situation” and engage in dialogue. Waddani and UCID 10 June postponed countrywide anti-govt protests scheduled for next day at request of elders to give mediation a chance. Earlier in month, parliament 6 June approved last three members of Committee for the Registration of Political Association with view to selecting new political parties; MPs late May had exchanged blows during session on the matter. Meanwhile, electoral commission disbanded, with chairman Abdirashid Mohamud Ali Rio-raac stepping down 1 June, followed by three remaining commission members 4 June. Parliament mid-June approved four out of seven proposed new commissioners. Manoeuvring within ruling coalition accelerated ahead of general elections expected in winter 2022; protesters rallied in capital Kathmandu against fuel price hikes amid growing economic strains. Buoyed by strong showing in local elections in May, ruling coalition member Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal 1 June threatened to reconsider alliance with Nepali Congress; observers saw Dahal’s remarks as aiming to secure power-sharing arrangement, including potential sharing of prime minister post with current PM and Nepali Congress chair Sher Bahadur Deuba in next govt. Dahal piled pressure on PM Deuba to not immediately approve reshuffling of ministerial portfolios that had been designated to Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Socialist) after party 5 June recalled its four cabinet representatives; new ministers were eventually sworn in 26 June following weeks of discord that roiled Unified Socialist party. Meanwhile, signs of discontent over economic situation emerged. Protesters 21-23 June took to streets in Kathmandu – including outside federal parliament – against fuel price hikes as some threw stones and damaged police vehicle, prompting govt to announce decrease in prices 25 June; devaluing Nepali rupee contributed to foreign debt liability rising by over $155mn in third quarter of current fiscal year.

Monitoring body confirmed roadmap to extend transitional govt’s rule to 2025; deadly violence persisted, notably in Upper Nile state as fighting erupted at site for displaced persons. After submitting a charter of demands seeking the overhaul of the constitutional order with the monarchy at the apex and the need for an elected Constituent Assembly — which were not paid heed to by the then Government — the Maoists embarked upon armed struggle in 1996 by focusing on guerilla actions in the remote western parts of Nepal in particular. Mr. Dahal, who by that time went by the name ‘Prachanda’ (the valiant), consolidated his control over the organisation, while his comrades in arms, Bhattarai ‘Laldwaj’ and Baidya ‘Kiran’, took up the initiative of being the face of the United Front and the ideological figurehead. By concerted militant actions targeting the police in remote districts and by utilising the political differences between the palace and the democratic establishment, the Maoists were slowly able to gain control in villages in a significant number of districts — mostly in the janajati (hill indigenous people) dominated western regions between 1996 and 2001. The Mashal group went on to term themselves as a party aligned with Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, essentially committing itself to the prospects of militant struggle and organising the peasantry to gain power in the rural areas and using them to to encircle the cities and capture power. It had in the mid-1980s already become part of the clandestine Revolutionary Internationalist Movement — the ideological group of like-minded Maoist parties which included the Shining Path of Peru. In 1986, a violent action by the Mashal group brought it under the scanner of the Nepal police and led to the arrest of its party cadre, with the fallout leading to the resignation of Mr. Baidya from the leadership of the party and the elevation of Mr. Dahal as the general secretary. Mr. Dahal reportedly underwent training in guerilla warfare in India in the late 1980s with help from the Maoist Communist Centre, then in undivided Bihar (the MCC was later to merge with the People’s War group to form the CPI (Maoist) in 2004). By articulating the demand for state restructuring to accommodate the political rights of representation for marginalised ethnic groups such as the Janajatis and the Madhesis (plain dwelling people) to be secured as federal autonomous provinces where such groups were in the majority, the Maoists broadened their support base. Under Prachanda’s leadership, the Maoists also managed to swiftly utilise the public anger against the monarchy following the Narayanhiti palace massacre in 2001. Soon the Prachanda-Baburam combine were able to convince the rest of the party/movement to consolidate the gains during the insurgency and to align with the democratic parties against the new king Gyanendra — a political strategy that led to the eight party alliance, the the Jan-Andolan-2, a comprehensive peace accord and later the deposing of the monarch and the concession of the demand for a Constituent Assembly.

We did not want that our boycott should be read with the boycotts in Kashmir. It should not be that at this time, others misinterpret our views and adversely affect national security. That is why we have agreed to call off our boycott.” The People’s Movement for Constitutional Safeguard, an umbrella body of the Ladakhi leadership, agreed to call off its boycott of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) elections scheduled for October 16. Former Minister in the Jammu and Kashmir government, Chhering Dorje, who quit the BJP in May, said that the demand for protection comes from the fear of demographic change, and the loss of potential employment for locals. The Ladakhi leaders said they had agreed to call off the boycott in the light of the government’s commitment, but also because they did not want to vitiate the atmosphere and adversely affect “national security” at a time the situation on the China border is tense. “The apex body of People’s Movement for sixth schedule for Ladakh, unanimously resolved to boycott the ensuing 6th LAHDC Leh elections till such time the constitutional safeguard under sixth schedule on the lines of Bodo Territorial Council is not extended to the UT Ladakh and its people,” veteran politician and former Lok Sabha MP Thupstan Chhewang said. In a joint statement, a group representatives of political parties such as the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and BJP, and leaders from different religious groups have unanimously decided to boycott the electoral exercise. The group, known as the Apex body of People’s Movement for 6th Schedule for Ladakh, was formed in August, when all religious and political groups joined hands to demand safeguards for the region. All political and religious organisations in Ladakh on Tuesday unanimously decided to boycott the upcoming hill council elections over their demand for bringing the region under the ambit of provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, PTI reported. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is also a signatory to the declaration calling for a boycott, along with 11 other parties. The other signatories include former MP Ps Skyabje Thiksey Khanpo Rinpochey and former Leh BJP president Chering Dorjey Lakrook. Lakrook had resigned from his post in May, after accusing the administration of failing to evacuate people of the Union Territory, who got stranded across the country amid the nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic. 2. A year of government policies that eroded hard-won land rights in Jammu and Kashmir Sanjeev PargalJAMMU, Sept 22: In a significant political development, all political parties, social and religious organizations today set aside their political and ideological differences, came on a joint platform in Leh under the banner of People’s Movement and announced boycott of sixth election to Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Leh scheduled to be held on October 16 till Ladakh is granted Sixth Schedule status and BODO Council-like powers to the two Councils of Leh and Kargil. They also opposed Jammu and Kashmir like Domicile Law in Ladakh saying this wasn’t acceptable to the people. Demand Sixth Schedule Status, powers for Councils; say no to Domicile Law Markets in Leh were deserted today after a half-day shutdown was observed in the district in the Ladakh region to protest against Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ashok Kaul’s comment, who called the demand for an extension of the sixth schedule of Constitution to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir “nonsense”. A call for a shutdown was given by the Merchant Association in Leh, who condemned Kaul’s comment and expressed their solidarity with the newly-formed People’s Movement in Ladakh. On Tuesday, the People’s Movement for the Sixth Schedule for Ladakh – a conglomeration of different political parties and socio-religious organizations – announced its decision to boycott the upcoming polls held by the LAHDC. The group said they would boycott the polls until constitutional safeguards on the lines of the Bodo Territorial Council were not extended to Ladakh. Speaking to NewsClick, Jet Namgyal, the president of the Merchant Association said that the statement by Kaul was “unacceptable and irresponsible and we unequivocally condemn it. The bandh was in support of the People Movement’s decision to boycott the upcoming Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) polls.” While the Muslim-majority Kargil region had opposed the Centre’s decision by protesting against it, the Buddhist-majority Leh had hailed it. A year later, a call for a boycott of the forthcoming elections echoes the fear among the residents about jobs, resources and the environment. Commenting on the BJP general secretary Koul’s statement, former chief executive councillor of Leh, Rigzin Spalbar said: “I think he should mind his own business. He has no locus standi. We, the people of Ladakh are demanding the Sixth Schedule for us. We are not demanding the Sixth Schedule for Ashok Koul or anyone else. People are hurt by his statement.” Notably, the Leh district president of the BJP, Nawang Samstan, is also a signatory to the poll boycott statement issued by the People’s Movement. Speaking to NewsClick, the former chief executive councillor of Leh, Rigzin Spalbar, had said: “We are not asking for anything outside our Constitution. People are very worried that they will be exploited by the non-tribals. People see this as an attempt to change the demography of the UT.” After successfully observing bandh for half the day, public protests were witnessed in Leh with people chanting slogans against Koul and demanding the implementation of the Sixth Schedule of the constitution, which provides autonomy to tribal areas. A special provision under Article 370 which granted land and job protection to the residents of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, including Ladakh, was abrogated last year following which the state was bifurcated into two union territories. The Apex Body managed to grab the attention of the central government after it called for a complete poll boycott ahead of the 6th general LAHDC elections in Leh district. On the other hand, Kargil Democratic Alliance, an amalgam of various political, social and religious organisations has from the beginning opposed the August 5, 2019 move of abrogation of Article 370, 35 A and bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. While a Legislative Assembly was restored to J&K, it was done away by the Centre in case of Ladakh UT. With New Delhi initiating the political process in the region, the Apex Body of Leh in Ladakh region has been deviating from the demand of the 6th schedule and instead asked for a full-fledged legislature like J&K. The border conflict suddenly intersected with these concerns when China said it refused to recognise the Union Territory of Ladakh. Political leaders in Ladakh were quick to denounce China’s statements. Around the same time, Lakrook quit the BJP to protest against the administration’s handling of the evacuation process. On September 22, leaders of the People’s Movement announced an election boycott until the Sixth Schedule demand was met. Signatories to the statement included  heads of the local party units of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party. “We condemn the recent remarks of the Chinese foreign ministry that they do not recognise the Union Territory of Ladakh,” Lakrook told reporters in Leh on October 2. “This is an unnecessary intervention in our internal affairs.” He also lashed out at China’s treatment of dissidents in Tibet and Xinjiang. “They should look into why they are committing atrocities there,” said Lakrook. Leaders in Leh admit that tensions on the Line of Actual Control and China’s belligerence made them rethink the boycott. “We didn’t want to give the Chinese a stick to beat us with,” said a leader of the People’s Movement, speaking off the record. “A boycott at this point of time, when the Chinese have internationalised the bifurcation of J&K, would not have been in the national interest. We didn’t want the country to lose face in international fora.” “The LAHDC chairman [in Leh] had to sit on a dharna at the gate to the LG’s [lieutenant governor’s] office,” said Jora. “Even then, he [the lieutenant governor] didn’t bother to come and see them.” The People’s Movement’s agitation has been suspended until the elections are over, said Lakrook. But it is a troubled council that goes into polls. As Ladakh became a Union Territory, local residents accused the Central administration of undermining the autonomous hill councils. “Union Territory status was never our demand – it was Leh’s demand,” explained Sheikh Nazir Ul Mehdi Mohammadi, President, Islamia School, one of the two influential religious schools in Kargil. “We had demanded divisional status within the state, which was accorded to us before the abrogation of Article 370. We are no way going to accept the division of Jammu and Kashmir and loss of its special status. When we didn’t demand a UT, how are we supposed to support or oppose the demand for Sixth Schedule? Neither we are in its favour, nor in its opposition.” A day after the boycott call, the BJP’s troubleshooter, Ram Madhav, landed in Leh to cool tempers. He was accompanied by Ashok Koul, a senior party leader from Jammu. Koul had initially dismissed the boycott resolution as “nonsense”. On September 24, Leh observed a  shutdown called by the People’s Movement. Mohammadi now feels Kargil’s Muslim-majority character has ensured neglect from Delhi. “There’s definitely a religious dimension to this treatment of Kargil,” he said. Those acquainted with Ladakh politics said the Congress failed to build on the momentum in the district against the BJP over the demand for protection to land and jobs for locals. “The Congress was never in the race. A good number of the seats the party won were through vote against the BJP for its anti-people policies, and not the votes in favour of the Congress which was in complete disarray,” said the journalist, wishing not to be named. The party’s “betrayal” on granting protection on jobs and land for locals, under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, brought the opposition and people on yo a single platform to fight for the “larger cause”. The disempowerment of people in matters relating to governance and day-to-day administrative affairs since Ladakh was made a separate Union territory in August last year was another reason for brewing anger against the party. In run up to the polls, political and religious bodies in Leh had joined hands to form the People’s Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh. The region saw several days of protests and shutdown, led by the body, to demand the extension of the Sixth Schedule to Ladakh. As the BJP-led government at the Centre saw the coming together of the groups as a major challenge, Union home minister Amit Shah met top members of the group in Delhi and persuaded them to call off the election boycott, assuring them that the government would “consider [their demands] positively”. Srinagar: When elections were announced to the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Leh, all odds were against the Bharatiya Janata Party. The party was ruling the local governing body of the mountainous region, bordering China. On the other hand, Choudhary said, the Congress lacks clarity on the political situation in Ladakh post August 5, 2019. He said there was a split among party leaders between Kargil and Leh over the Union territory status for Ladakh, with Kargil demanding a reversal of the decisions taken on August 5 last year, when the government of India read down J&K’s special status and split the state into two federal territories. Kargil-based political activist Sajad Hussain said the AAP’s decision to contest the polls ended up eating into the votes of the Congress. “At several places the Congress lost by double-digit votes which were polled by the AAP party,” said Hussain. “Never ever have Central ministers campaigned in local council election in Ladakh. This showed a lack of confidence by the BJP in local leadership,” said senior Congress leader Nawang Rigzin Jora. For the Congress, Jora, a former minister in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was the lone “star campaigner” to challenge the BJP’s strategy. Not a single top Congress leader from Delhi flew to Ladakh to boost the morale of their local leaders. In response, the Apex Body called for a complete boycott of the upcoming LAHDC elections. “The Apex Body of Peoples Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh, unanimously resolved to boycott the ensuing 6th LAHDC Leh election till such time the constitutional safeguard under the sixth schedule on the lines of Bodo territorial council in not extended to UT Ladakh and its people,” said a statement that is signed by heads of different religious, political and student groups. A recent development dragged media attention from Ladakh’s border to inner Ladakh when a body called the “Apex Body of Peoples Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh” called for complete boycott of the upcoming sixth round of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Leh elections. This came immediately after a media report suggested the central government had defied Ladakh’s demand for inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian constitution. Nonetheless, the Muslim-majority Kargil district is silent on the demand for Sixth Schedule inclusion as they have always maintained the need to restore statehood and Article 370 for the region. “Why don’t they ask for statehood for Ladakh with the legislature? We are not with the UT. We do not support the extension of the Sixth Schedule. We are and have always been against the division of the state,” former Member of Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly Asgar Ali Karbali was quoted by media. The stand of the BJP came under question when the general secretary of Jammu and Kashmir Ashok Kaul in a controversial statement to a media outlet denigrated the election boycott. He was quoted as saying that “This resolution means nothing. Yeh Sab Bakwas hai (All these are nonsense). We are going to Leh soon to talk to our people and we will fix everything.” Immediately, Kaul, accompanied by another BJP leader, Ram Madhav, reached Leh triggering protests by students over Kaul’s “irresponsible statement.” In a sharp contrast to the resolution passed by the LAHDC Leh, the public representatives of Sham region of Leh unanimously rejected the demand for “Article 371” and “Domicile Law” and revived the demand to include Ladakh in Sixth Schedule. Grabbing this opportunity as a launching pad, the elders in Leh — whom the locals call “veteran leaders” — intensified the demand for Sixth Schedule and a legislature for the centrally administered Union Territory (UT). The demand was made in a joint meeting that was attended by veteran leaders, representatives of various religions (Buddhists, Christians, Sunnis, Shias), student organizations and political parties. The group of the veteran leaders that now has emerged as a group called “Apex Body of Peoples Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh” along with District Congress Committee, Bahujan Samaj Party, and many other were very quick to condemn Kaul’s statement. Later, Kaul himself in a press conference in Leh claimed that the media has “twisted” his comments, and further said that he stood behind all the demands made by the people of Ladakh. The district president of the BJP is a signatory to the joint statement that demanded Sixth Schedule protection for Ladakh. However, the current situation has emerged as a conundrum to the BJP local unit. It is only in this election that the BJP and its MP has pushed for it, after having opposed it for a year. From their opposition, it seems New Delhi has communicated to the MP that Sixth Schedule protection is out of question for Ladakh. However, any opposition to the Sixth Schedule demand at this time would cause huge political setback for the party in the upcoming LAHDC election. Meanwhile, a media report revealed that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has ruled out the granting of tribal status to Ladakh noting that the powers given to two autonomous hill development council of Leh and Kargil are in line with the Sixth Schedule of the constitution of India. This was stated by Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy in response to a written question by Sajjad Ahmad in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Indian parliament. The Delhi meeting with Shah has somewhat silenced the protests in Leh but not reduced the apprehensions of the locals. Only a clear promise to fulfill the demand of Sixth Schedule inclusion can reestablish the BJP on LAHDC Leh but the party’s leadership in New Delhi remains noncommittal. After one year of Union Territory status, in absence of any “constitutional safeguard,” people in Ladakh fear loss of land, jobs, change in demography, erosion of their unique culture, and pollution of a fragile environment. In particular, the people of Leh have started demanding safeguarding Ladakh’s land, employment opportunities, culture and environment through inclusion into the Sixth Schedule of Indian Constitution which grants special provisions to tribal areas in India’s northeast. In effect, by allowing Autonomous District Councils under the Sixth Schedule, their leaders can legislate to restrict land acquisitions and jobs to locals. Ladakh had enjoyed analogous autonomy as part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir through Article 35A of the Indian Constitution till it was repealed in August last year. The Apex Body managed to grab the attention of the central government after it called for a complete poll boycott ahead of the 6th general LAHDC elections in Leh district. He maintained that under the 6th schedule legislature will be very weak and the body will hold talks with Kargil-based leaders as well. “The demand for the 6th schedule has been withdrawn. It will be UT Ladakh with a legislature for the people of this region. The same will be put forth to the MoS Home GK Reddy during the talks to be held soon,” he said. Leh, Jun 23 : With New Delhi initiating the political process in Jammu and Kashmir, the Apex Body of Leh in Ladakh region Wednesday deviated from the demand of the 6th schedule and said that they will be asking for a Union Territory (UT) with a full-fledged legislature. The ‘Apex Committee for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh’, an amalgam of different political parties and socio-religious organisations, last month announced that it would boycott the polls until the constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule on the lines of the Bodo Territorial Council are extended to Ladakh. The BJP’s Leh district president was also a signatory to the joint resolution for Sixth Schedule, but its general secretary for J&K and Ladakh units Ashok Koul termed the boycott call as “bakwas (nonsense)”, triggering protests and a shutdown in the region. Also read: Ladakh Body Withdraws Poll Boycott After Centre Blinks on Sixth Schedule Demand He claimed that BJP is rushing Union Ministers to Leh for campaigning as “they find the going tough” here. “The people are against BJP because there are no safeguards for jobs, land and our distinct culture. We will fight for protecting rights of Ladakhis,” he said. The conglomerate’s boycott call sent alarm bells ringing in New Delhi, prompting the Centre to open channels of communication with the leadership. The Centre’s intervention may have managed to calm the political crisis and salvage the BJP’s image to some extent, but the party’s problems are far from over. Ticket distribution has sparked trouble within its ranks, and several leaders have deserted the party. Those acquainted with Council politics claim that this is the first time that Central ministers from other states are campaigning for any party in the elections. “Union ministers have never come here during Hill Council elections. They usually used to come for campaigning during the Lok Sabha elections,” says Chering Dorjey Lakrook, former chief executive councilor of Leh and ex-minister in the erstwhile state of J&K. In a damage-control move, Koul later claimed that his remarks were twisted and he stood behind all the demands made by the people of Leh. Those familiar with local politics of Leh told The Wire that the usually predictable electoral sentiment of the region is now mired in ambiguity and confusion. Unlike previous elections, they said, it is difficult to predict a winner this time."

Receding glaciers would also have an impact on the rates of groundwater recharge in some areas,” says the study. The decline in groundwater due to anticipated decline of glacial meltwater is likely to affect the Ganges basin the most, it says. The study, carried out by Dr Anjal Prakash, IPCC author and Research Director of Bharti Institute of Public Policy at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, says that unless a coherent nationwide policy is developed for springs and Himalayan groundwater, villages and towns in the region will face a severe water crisis in coming decades. “In many parts of HKH springs are drying up due to prolonged pre-monsoon drought as a result of climate change, threatening the way of life for local communities and downstream areas,” said Dr Vishal Singh, Executive Director of Centre for Ecology Development and Research. A study commissioned by the Observer Research Foundation, published this month, has found that the retreat of glaciers in the Himalayan Hindu Kush region is now affecting the surface water and groundwater availability in the region, and has adversely affected springs – a lifeline for the population in hill areas. “Glacial decline is closely related to climate change. The study looks at the interconnectivity between this and the groundwater and surface water in the area. There are 5 million springs in the Himalayas and they are showing a decline because of overuse by an increasing population, but also because of retreating glaciers and depleting ground water levels. This is alarming because the populations that live in the upper and middle Himalayas, in villages and even towns, are dependent on spring water. NITI Aayog has set up a committee to look at springs in the Himalayas. But there needs to be a mission mode policy on this,” said Dr Prakash. Climate warming is affecting hydrological regimes in the HKH region because of factors like changes in seasonal extremes, increased evapotranspiration, and changes in glacier volume. But increased melt may also trigger landslides or glacial lake outburst floods, known as GLOFs, scientists warn. Or it could aggravate the impact of extreme rainfall, like the deluge that caused recent massive flooding in Pakistan. Changes in melt could also affect the safety and productivity of the region’s expanding hydropower industry. Countries like Nepal already get most of their electricity from hydropower; others, like India, are planning to increase capacity of this low-carbon energy source. Around 650 hydro projects are planned or underway in high-altitude locations across the region, many of them close to glaciers or glacial lakes. These glaciers can block valleys and create lakes, which is what happened when the Shisper Glacier, in Gilgit-Baltistan, began surging in 2017. The advancing ice blocked a river that flowed from an adjacent glacier, creating a new lake. “Once the water pressure is high enough, it lifts the glacier ice and then drains immediately, like a flash flood,” says Bolch. Lakes formed by this glacier burst in 2019 and 2020, and again this May. In July, government officials in Pakistan determined that unusual heat waves had contributed to 16 glacial lake outbursts in the mountains this year, compared with just five or six in previous years. The Shisper lake outburst in May did not take any lives, due in part to a glacier monitoring system set up under a United Nations Development Programme project. Still, the timing of the outburst was not expected, says ICIMOD’s Muhamad. And with the Karakoram Highway and Hassanabad village only a few kilometers away, destruction was almost inevitable. The flood destroyed two homes and damaged 16 others, washed away farms and orchards, and knocked out the local power supply. The collapse of the Hassanabad bridge cut a key link in the remote northern region, stranding tourists and threatening food supply. Rebuilding a permanent bridge, officials said, could take up to eight months. Pakistan’s climate change minister, Sherry Rehman, tweeted videos of the destruction and highlighted the vulnerability of a region with the largest number of glaciers outside the Earth’s poles. Why were these glaciers losing mass so quickly? Rehman put it succinctly. “High global temperatures,” she said. A few days ago @ClimateChangePK had warned that Pakistan’s vulnerability is high due to high temps. Hassanabad bridge on the KKH collapsed due to GLOF from the melting Shisper glacier which caused erosion under pillars. Am told FWO will have a temporary bridge up in 48 hours. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/Sjl9QIMI0G Moreover, the measurements that do exist often don’t get shared, Bolch adds, noting, “This is a political issue.” Governments in the region need to be more collaborative, agrees Khan, in Islamabad. “If countries are isolated and don’t share, we won’t know,” she says. “We’re all part of the same region, and we all get water from the same source. Anything that happens [in one place] is going to have a cascading effect on all of us.” More glacial lakes means greater risk of glacial lake outburst floods, when land or ice holding back a lake can suddenly give way, releasing a huge volume of water. One study projects almost a threefold rise in the risk of lake outbursts in the region, posing a hazard to mountain villages, roads, and hydropower dams. Some studies suggest that glaciers covered by debris such as rocks and pebbles, which protects the glacial surface from the sun’s radiation, may melt more slowly. “The blanket protects the ice,” says Mohammed Farooq Azam, a glaciologist with the Indian Institute of Technology in Indore. Despite the advances in knowledge about Himalayan glaciers, scientists say many research gaps remain. The role of black carbon, or soot, in accelerating melt is not fully known. Air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic plains is thought to be depositing black carbon on the mountains, increasing the absorption of heat and accelerating melt. There is also almost no data on permafrost, the ice that lies beneath the ground and can influence water flows and slope stability. “When permafrost thaws, the soil surface loses strength and can subside, destroying roads,” says Azam. These melt patterns may have to do with regional climatic differences, says Sher Muhammad, a remote sensing specialist with Nepal’s International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an intergovernmental institute at the forefront of climate research in the region. The eastern Himalayas are strongly influenced by the Asian summer monsoon and get more rainfall than snowfall, he notes. On the other hand, the western Himalayas, as well as the Hindu Kush and Karakoram, are more influenced by what are known as the western disturbances, which bring more snowfall. Glaciers in the west are also larger, Muhammad says, and respond more slowly to climatic changes. Seismic activity and a buildup of water pressure can cause glaciers to burst, making climate change a particular concern. “Many of these lakes are upstream of steep river valleys and have the potential to cause extreme flooding when they break. Where these floods reach inhabited regions and sensitive infrastructure, things will be catastrophic.” The region where the glacial burst occurred is prone to landslide and flash flooding, and environmentalists have cautioned against building there. As a burst Himalayan glacier wreaks havoc in India, we look at how glaciers and glacial lakes form, and why they sometimes break. Here is how glaciers and glacial lakes form and why they sometimes break: Proglacial lakes, formed after glaciers retreat, are often bound by sediment and boulder formations. The floods that slammed into two hydroelectric plants and damaged villages in northern India on Sunday were set off by an upstream break in a western Himalayan glacier. A number of imminent potentially deadly glacier burst and flood situations have been identified worldwide, including in the Himalayas and South American Andes. Additional water or pressure, or structural weakness, can cause both natural and man-made dams to burst, sending a mass of floodwater surging down the rivers and streams fed by the glacier. It is not yet known what caused part of the Nanda Devi glacier to snap off on Sunday morning, sending floodwater surging downstream towards power plants and villages in India’s northern state of Uttarakhand. This, the researchers said, will eventually lead to water shortages.

The glacier collapse at Joshimath on Sunday led to a massive flood in the Dhauli Ganga river and caused large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas. By Press Trust of India: As a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district on Sunday, leading to massive floods, a study published in 2019 had warned that Himalayan glaciers have been melting twice as fast since the start of this century due to climate change. ""This is the clearest picture yet of how fast Himalayan glaciers are melting over this time interval, and why,"" said Joshua Maurer, a PhD candidate at Columbia University in the US. The data indicates that the melting is consistent in time and space, and that rising temperatures are to blame, the researchers said. The study shows that ""even glaciers in the highest mountains of the world are responding to global air temperature increases driven by the combustion of fossil fuels,"" said Joseph Shea, a glacial geographer at the University of Northern British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved in the study. Some glaciers in Alaska, Iceland, the Alps, the Pamir mountains and the Himalayas were among the most impacted by melting, researchers found. Glaciers with surrounding communities provide an important water source and their decline could lead to serious food and water shortages.

Scientists have long warned that warming temperatures driven by climate change are eating into glaciers and ice sheets around the world, contributing to higher sea levels that threaten the world's populous coastal cities. The latest reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that future sea levels will rise by more than a meter by 2100. McNabb said the study's overall picture was one of ""fairly rapid"" ice mass loss, with no indication it would change soon, but there is still time to put the brakes on melt by reducing emissions. While the study did not delve into the cause of the glacial retreat, rising temperatures widely believed by scientists to be the result of human emissions were inevitably leading to more ice loss, McNabb said. ""Those areas are seeing a rapid pace of glacier melt that could be fairly worrying,"" McNabb said. ""I have no expectation, in all honesty, that even substantial action to reduce our emissions and control the Earth's temperature rise is going to grow our glaciers,"" Moon said. ""We're at a point where we're trying to keep as much ice as possible and slow that rate of loss,"" she added. ""When you see something like this where glaciers are losing mass, it's getting faster, that sounds really bad,"" he said. ""But there's something that we can do here, we need to act."" Glaciers tend to have a faster response to climate change compared with ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and are currently contributing more to sea level rise that either individual ice sheet, scientists said. “Recent devastating flash floods attributed to a collapsing glacier in the Himalayas were a sobering reminder of the sometimes disastrous effects of climate change and the dangers we have to protect against,” said Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Vice President for South Asia. “As glaciers shrink, the lives and livelihoods of many people downstream are affected by changes in the water supply. We can slow glacier melt by collectively acting to curb the black carbon deposits that are speeding the thinning of the ice. Regional cooperation to protect these resources will pay important dividends for the health and well-being of the people in the region.” “Water resource management policies must evolve because the trends we are observing point to a different and more challenging future,” said Muthukumara Mani, lead economist in the World Bank’s South Asia region and a lead author of the report. “Success will require an active and agile cooperation between researchers and policymakers so both groups can continue to learn about the problems at hand.” Finally, countries in South Asia must work together to manage hydropower resources, an important source for the region’s clean energy needs and a generator of energy trade and security. Unstable water flow from glacier melt and more variable precipitation underscore the need to stabilize availability over the longer term to make hydropower more viable. Glaciers of the Himalayas finds that in addition to changing temperatures and precipitation patterns, black carbon deposits – air-borne particles generated by incomplete combustion from brick kilns, diesel exhaust, and the burning of biomass – are accelerating glacier and snow melt in these ranges. Business-as-usual practices would further speed glacier melt, with harmful implications for the health and well-being of people in the region. Melting Glaciers, Loss of Snow Pose Risks to South Asia Water Resources WASHINGTON, June 3, 2021 – Black carbon deposits originating from factories, cooking and vehicles are compounding the effects of climate change to speed up the melting of the Himalayan glaciers. More aggressively curbing black carbon emissions can slow glacier melt and improve the security of water resources in the region, according to a new World Bank report. Similar to Zanskar, Spiti is facing an acute water shortage, which affects its agriculture, tourism and life in general. And like any other water-scarce region, Spiti’s women suffer disproportionately. She added that decreased and unseasonal snowfall, warmer summers and air pollution have led to rapid depletion of glaciers. ""And it is the women who are facing the real challenge,"" she said. ""We do not get time for ourselves. All we do is fetch water and tend to household chores."" Alok Sikka, the India Representative of the International Water Management Institute, told FairPlanet that placing the burden of securing water for households on women alone is in ""our culture and there is a need to change that."" But evident changes in the ice fields could adversely impact the lives of the people dependent on these water sources, with several studies indicating that a rising concentration of black carbon aerosol is causing the glaciers in this Himalayan region to melt rapidly. It’s not just the burden of household chores, ""but this gender-specific role impacts the health, education and social life of these women,"" Gyalmo said, adding that women are left shouldering the responsibility of the household and they lose agency in matters where they should have a say. Gyalmo further said that women in water-scarce areas in Zanskar get little time to engage in self-care. ""With the acute crisis, women have little access to clean sanitation. It affects both their physical and mental health."" Carrying jerry cans and buckets of water over long distances generates back and posture problems for women, and Chosdal shared that she is currently on medication due to persistent pain in her joints and back. ""The way we treat women needs to change,"" Sikka emphasized, ""and the culture of men doing their bit to fetch and arrange for water in water-scarce regions is the need of the hour."" Dolma says she was not able to continue her studies because she had to look after her household. ""And imagine trekking four miles every day to fetch water, in the freezing cold, and then doing other chores,"" she lamented. ""Our life is wasted in fetching water."" Back in Zanskar, Chosdal said it is difficult to maintain basic hygiene without sufficient water. ""How often do you get to bathe in the winter?"" FairPlanet asked.

Besides, the house also resolved that the Government of India and NSCN must seek a final agreement based on the historic Framework Agreement of 3rd August, 2015.” In a joint council meeting of the NSCN-IM held at its Hebron camp in Dimapur on Friday, it was unanimously decided that the IM’s standing demand of a separate flag and constitution need to be a part of the final settlement in the ongoing Naga peace talks with the Centre. Editorial | Peace is precious: Centre and NSCN-IM should keep the conversation going, show wisdom and sagacity to conclude agreement Guwahati: The separatist National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak Muivah (NSCN-IM) Sunday reiterated that it would be sticking by its demand for a separate flag and constitution. “Apparently, since the Government of India started negotiations with NNPG, the sudden demand, and claim for Flag and Constitution became necessary (allegedly for NSCN-IM) in order to prolong and sabotage possible Indo-Naga solution,” Kitovi was reported to have said. “The ball is now in the court of the Government of India to make the right move and to fulfil the commitment given to the Nagas,” Muivah said, adding that a ceasefire without political negotiations held no meaning. Its interpretation, however, has become a hurdle in the peace talks — especially with NSCN-IM interpreting phrases like “shared sovereignty” to mean that the Nagas are different and their “sovereignty” has to be retained. Back in April, A.K. Mishra, the central government’s interlocutor for the Naga peace talks, had conveyed during a visit to Nagaland that there would be no change in the government’s stand on the group’s demand, which would only allow for a “separate flag for cultural activities”. On 14 August 1947, members of the Naga National Council —  the parent body of the NSCN I-M — declared independence from the British in order to be seen as a separate nation from India. The organisation marks the day as Naga Independence Day ever since. Also Read: Words, phrases don’t mean the same – Why peace talks with the Nagas have been stuck The meeting also reiterated that the NSCN (I-M) would never give up the Naga flag and constitution for the sake of a solution as they “define our political identity”. The Centre has offered to come mid-way: that the Naga flag be used for ‘cultural’ purposes, and that a portion of the Yehzabo (Naga constitution) be inserted into the Indian Constitution. Speaking to The Indian Express, an NSCN (I-M) leader said: “We are not a cultural body or NGO. It (a cultural flag/constitution) is unacceptable.” Now, the attacks by the BJP and other parties on the NSCN (I-M) indicate a fresh push to solve the issue. The NPF’s Nienu says talks are such a “political hot potato” again because the Centre means “business” now. Led by Assam Chief Minister and the BJP’s Northeast face Himanta Biswa Sarma, the Centre has been trying to resolve the inter-state disputes and insurgencies in the region. Then, Kuzholuzo (Azo) Nienu of the Naga People’s Front (NPF), which is a part of the ruling coalition including the BJP, said it was time for the NSCN (I-M) to “take it (the Centre’s offer) or leave it”. The state’s tribal organisations, too, have weighed in. “We are not part of the peace process, but we want the negotiators to be realistic, and hammer out whatever is possible,” said a Nagaland Tribes Council leader. A member of the Naga Hoho, the apex tribal body, said while he could not comment on “who is right, who was wrong”, he said it was not entirely fair to blame the NSCN (I-M). “If one goes by the framework agreement, what the NSCN is asking for is not wrong,” he said. State BJP president Temjen Imna Along recently said in the state assembly that the NSCN (I-M)’s demand for a separate flag and constitution – one of the intractable points over which the Naga solution is stuck – had been described as Union Home Minister Amit Shah as “unachievable”, even in “400 years”. Last month, Deputy Chief Minister Y Patton, also of the BJP, took it a step further: in a speech at the Central Nagaland Tribes Council in Wokha, Patton said the insurgents did not want a solution, but wanted to “enjoy the comforts of life with money collected as taxes through extortion”. Tora AgarwalaTora covers the Northeast for <em>The Indian Express. </em>Follow her... read more Veteran politician and former Nagaland chief minister S C Jamir has been meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah frequently on the issue, ignoring the NSCN (I-M) complaints that he appeared to be siding with them. Recently in Nagaland, Jamir warned of an “impending earthquake”, with its epicentre in Delhi. After the meeting, the Assam Chief Minister had tweeted: “PM Shri Narendra Modi and HM Shri Amit Shah are committed to ensure ever-lasting peace in the Northeast. At Dimapur today, we held discussions with NSCN (IM) representatives in the presence of Nagaland CM Shri Neiphiu Rio about the ongoing peace talks with GoI.” Stating that a separate flag and constitution are uncompromising issues, the NSCN (IM) leader said: “Any agreement without a separate flag and constitution is unacceptable and meaningless. The solution must be inclusive. We can’t sign an agreement ignoring the sentiments of our cadre. “In another development, assigned by the Home Minister Amit Shah, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday rushed to Dimapur and held meetings with the NSCN (IM) leaders, his Nagaland counterpart Neiphiu Rio, leaders of various political parties, Naga groups and senior government officials to take forward the much-debated Naga peace talks. The opposition Congress in Assam has raised questions over the Assam Chief Minister’s involvement in the Naga peace talks and said that the state’s interest may be compromised in the long run. For the first time in the Naga peace talks, the Assam Chief Minister has been involved in the discussions. Officials said that Sarma, who is also the Convener of the pro-BJP front North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), held meetings with the former special director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Central government representative A.K. Mishra and the General Secretary of the NSCN (IM) Thuingaleng Muivah. By Indrajit Kundu: Reiterating its position that there can be no ""honourable solution"" to the Naga Peace talks without a separate flag and a constitution, National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) chief T Muivah on Friday said Nagas will ""not merge with India"". Muivah claimed that both flag and a constitution were symbols of Naga nationhood. ""We are not asking for Naga national flag and constitution from the Government of India. Recognize them or not, we have our own flag and constitution. The Nagas must keep their flag and constitution,"" he said. Claiming that Nagas and Indians were ""poles apart in terms of history, race, identity, culture, language, geography, political concept and faith"", Muivah said there was a need to find a common meeting point so that the two could co-exist together as two entities. In his annual 'Naga Independence Day' address, Muivah said, ""Nagas will co-exist with India sharing sovereign powers as agreed in the Framework Agreement and defined in the competencies. But they will not merge with India."" The statement comes just days after NSCN (IM) sought removal of RN Ravi, the interlocutor appointed by Government of India for the peace talks, accusing him of twisting the framework agreement to push his own narrative. The NSCN(IM) chief claimed that in the Framework Agreement the Government of India had recognised the sovereignty of the Nagas. The agreement, he claimed, mentions, ""Inclusive peaceful co-existence of the two entities sharing sovereign power"". However, reiterating the stand of the NSCN (I-M), deputy kilonser Kehoi Swu told ThePrint: “If the issues of flag and constitution cannot be resolved now according to the wishes and the rights of the Nagas, anything that is signed now will not last long.” Guwahati: The working committee of the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) Tuesday said it is ready for an agreement with the Government of India. The announcement comes amid last week’s speculation that the Naga Peace Talks might collapse, and Thuingaleng Muivah, Ato Kilonser (general secretary) of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), stating in a recent interview that the Nagas will never be part of the Indian Union or accept India’s Constitution. In February this year, Muivah had written to PM Modi, requesting the government to facilitate talks “outside India in a third country”. “Naga history reserves the right to determine who masterminded divisions, gave genocidal ideas, put them into action and interpreted covert tribal supremacy as ‘national principle’ or ‘Naga nationalism’,” he said, adding that future generations should be allowed to determine who lived and died as a ‘traitor’ or ‘anti-Naga’. Sources said Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio and Leader of the Opposition T.R. Zeliang, along with North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convener and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi Tuesday over the talks.

Asked precisely if the NNPGs are ready to sign an agreement leaving out the NSCN (I-M), WC coordinator Alezo Venuh told ThePrint: “It is up to the I-M; they have also agreed for a solution on 31 October 2019. We cannot speak on their behalf.” (This report has been updated with a reaction from NSCN (I-M)’s Kehoi Swu.) The prayer meeting came at a time when steps are being taken at various quarters to ensure a meeting between the NSCN(IM) and umbrella organisation NNPG — the two principal stakeholders in the peace talks. As an indication of some kind of reconciliation the hardliner NSCN-IM is likely to take,the organisation chairman Tuccu (whose speech was read out in absentia) said –“…there was no other way forward to sustain our movement when we placed under the crucial juncture in order to bring yielding temperament on the part of the Government of India to respect and honour the historical and political rights.” The two warring sides NNPG and NSCN-IM are now likely to meet ‘outside Nagaland’ soon to hammer out differences. While the NNPG led by N. Kitovi Zhimomi is keen for inking a final peace pace, the NSCN-IM led by Muivah has been raising the bogied of a separate Constitution and Flag. Both the demands have been rejected by the Government of India with Home Minister Amit Shah telling a Naga delegation that such contentious issues cannot be entertained and hence need not be raised. New Delhi:  Eminent Naga Christian leader Rev Dr V.K.

Khaplang (Hemi Naga from Myanmar) need to apologise for going against the ‘institution of the Naga National Council (NNC) by forming the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) on January 31, 1980. This also lays emphasis for an early solution and to bring a lasting peace in Nagaland and adjoining hubs in Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh where sizable Naga population reside. The NSCN (IM) has reiterated that it is looking for an honourable solution, and also added that without a separate flag and constitution, the peace deal with the Centre will not be honourable. On this line, at a recent meeting Chief Minister Rio said that, regarding having a ‘Naga Yezahbo’ (constitution), the Article 371(A) of the Constitution grants special provisions, but to frame a separate constitution for the Nagas, a committee would be set up. In 1997, the Union Government of India signed a ceasefire agreement with the NSCN-IM (National Socialist Council of Nagaland, Isak & Muivah faction) and started a peace initiative popularly termed as peace talks. Another ceasefire was signed with NSCN-K (National Socialist Council of Nagaland, S. S. Khaplang faction) in 2001 but negotiations failed to move forward. Regarding the concern of the separate flag and the constitution, the official said that ‘the government is exploring the possibilities’. The Naga group alleged that Ravi had “manipulated” the document in his submission to the parliamentary standing committee to suggest that any solution would be within the limits of the Indian Constitution and concerned only the state of Nagaland. On August 14, in a speech to commemorate ‘Naga Independence Day’, NSCN-IM chief Thuingaleng Muivah declared Nagas would co-exist, but not merge with India. Senior officials of the Nagaland Government who are associated with the ongoing peace talks said that both the state govt of Nagaland and the union govt are keen to ensure that the peace pact gets inked as a lot of goodwill at both the state and the central level is involved. Meanwhile, in an attempt to ensure that the talks on the peace process don’t derail, the government is holding parleys at different levels and the state government of Nagaland has reached out to various civil society groups in Nagaland, besides reaching out to the Union Government and the leadership of the NSCN to ensure that the process doesn’t derail. Then in 1997, the NSCN (IM) signed a ceasefire agreement with the government in 1997. The NSCN (IM) mentioned that the ceasefire agreement was signed to seek a lasting political solution to the problem. “The house had unanimously adopted the resolution to reiterate the stand of NSCN-IM that the Naga national flag and Yehzabo (constitution) must form a part of the Indo-Naga political solution in order to qualify the Naga deal as honourable and acceptable,” NSCN-IM said in a press statement. “The central government is working hard to bring a solution to the Naga issue. The Naga people also want peace and unity to come through a permanent solution so that we can have development and open up avenues for youths,” Rio said at a recent meeting."

Ruling Georgian Dream party 1 July presented plan, listing new commissions and existing ministries responsible for reforms, along with timeline; group of civil society organisations 3 July released its own plan. Many opposition politicians and president 11 July voiced concerns about leadership’s readiness to initiate genuine process that might satisfy EU demands. Several leading civil society organisations 12 July declared readiness to support ruling party, while president with support of remaining opposition 15 July signed decree initiating special parliamentary session for debates on fulfilling recommendations; ruling party 18 July promised to boycott session.

Leading the government side in talks with representatives of the farmer unions protesting the three farm laws, Tomar has emerged as the negotiator-in-chief for the ruling dispensation. While talks have failed to break the deadlock, Tomar has ensured that the space is kept open for the next round. He also played a key role in the BJP’s return to power in Madhya Pradesh. He steered the state deftly through the pandemic and the farmers’ agitation. With the three new farm laws driving a wedge between Akali Dal and the BJP, and AAP putting up a desultory performance, he has emerged as the undisputed leader of the state. Although three petitions in the Supreme Court challenged the Central Vista redevelopment last year, the ruling favoured the project. He successfully defended Future Group Limited in its ‘battle’ against e-commerce giant Amazon in the Delhi High Court over the Future-Reliance deal. She weathered the crisis in the party after 23 dissidents wrote a letter asking for reforms. At the Congress Working Committee meeting where it was decided that she will remain interim president, she asked the dissidents — G23 — to move on. Tomar has been made in-charge of the Assam Assembly polls by his party. He is manoeuvering his party through the anti-incumbency headwinds. He has managed to retain his position in the party organisation following the recent reshuffle, despite being at the receiving end of the PM’s criticism of his son at a BJP parliamentary party meeting. One of Home Minister Amit Shah’s closest confidants, Vijayvargiya has been given the charge of ensuring the party’s success in the coming Assembly elections in West Bengal.

His NGO Common Cause has filed a PIL in the Supreme Court seeking appointment of a full-time Director for the CBI. The outcome will be significant for the central probe agency. He is one leader in the down-and-out Opposition who still manages to rattle the ruling establishment. With party chief Sonia Gandhi confined to her home, Gandhi is leading the Congress campaign in the Assembly elections.

Govt pursued “Total Peace” plan aimed at reviving negotiations with National Liberation Army (ELN) and demobilising other armed groups. Notably, after high-level govt delegation visited Cuba in Aug to meet ELN negotiating team, Venezuela 13 Sept agreed to act as guarantor in possible forthcoming talks.

We are undergoing the third wave of a global pandemic, and real estate sector being one of the largest employing sectors of the nation has so much to fulfill and achieve. Availability of affordable home loans and the importance of owning a home are two major driving factors for revival. However, there still remains certain aspect which needs government’s attention especially as the Union Budget 2022-23 draws near. One of the most long-standing demand being ‘Industry Status to Real Estate Sector’, not having an ‘industry status’ becomes difficult for real estate sector to avail legitimate finances from banks and other financial institutions.  It will help in getting low cost loans from the system, and then the cost benefit with regard to high interest loans from outside the system can be further moved on to the end-users. We also expect that the input credit regime should be brought back into the GST regime as far as the Residential real estate is concerned. With all the benefits being passed on to the homebuyers, if it gets implemented the benefits achieved will make the entire homebuying process affordable. It will also shield both buyers and developers from the cost implications of fluctuating cost of raw materials. Developing a home is a huge responsibility, and it takes in a lot of efforts from developers, authorities must address the long-standing demands from the developer community which include Single Window Clearance to facilitate faster deliveries and project completions, exemption limit on Interest on Home loan, for supporting millions of first time buyers across the nation, and Principal Deduction Rules Under Section 80 C to be implemented. This will make sure that the deduction of principal amount of housing loan repaid would not be clubbed with other deductions under Section 80C. Alternatively, the limit under Section 80C should be increased to Rs 3 lakhs. “With respect to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian economy grew 8.4% in the 3rd quarter of 2021. While India is going through another wave of the pandemic, it is crucial to closely examine and redefine the wealth, investment, and tax reforms of the country. To keep the growth intact, tax policies on investments in global stocks and foreign direct investments should promptly be reviewed. While the tax revenue is of crucial importance to the recovery of the Indian economy, a balanced approach towards GST, property tax liability, and stamp duty will play a very important role in determining an average Indian’s ability to invest in the real estate sector. Starting from the remotest of areas in the country, a focus on investments in townships and infrastructure is equally important to help the Indian economy rise back to its full potential.” India, standing in the 3rd position in terms of the largest startup ecosystem in the world, arises the demand for new policies and initiatives that support their growth from the Indian government which will allow the whole nation to flourish in terms of the global economy. Some of the core expectations from the startup sector are tax relief and the easy accessibility of capital funds. When ESOPs are given to the employees as the biggest factor of motivation where an attractive package cannot be offered initially, the government is expected to allow deferred tax payment on ESOP buyback distribution tax or can try to waive off the aggregated tax percentage of 23.30% on the distributed income. The startup community expects policies and reforms that can make the MSMEs and other tech-based startups get access to the unmet capital needs of the organization. Also, a huge group of young entrepreneurs requests for simplifying the GST compliances for online selling, through which they can make use of the several e-commerce platforms to the optimum level, ultimately enabling for magnified economic growth. ""Housing demand did bounce back strongly after the first as well as the second wave of the COVID pandemic, driven mainly by historical low interest rates on home loans. However, the sector is still plagued with two perennial problems -- unsold inventories and stalled projects.  The third wave -- in the form of the Omicron variant of the Coronavirus -- has emerged as a challenge for the sector and the economy. To deal with the legacy issues and also this new challenge, the real estate sector needs support in the upcoming Budget. The corpus of the government-backed stress fund SWAMIH should be hiked to at least Rs 1 lakh crore. The current corpus of Rs 25,000 crore has already been committed. This will help in completion of stuck projects and bring back the much-needed consumers' trust in the under construction property market. The government should give more tax incentives for both principal and interest paid on home loans. The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) should be extended for EWS-LIG and reintroduced for the MIG segment. The government has taken some bold measures to promote rental housing -- framing of model tenancy law and launch of Affordable Rental Housing Complexes. Tax sops should be provided to boost both supply and demand of rental housing. Rental yields are lower in residential properties compared with office assets. This can be compensated through tax incentives to developers and property buyers. As we enter the third year of pandemic, it is evident that nurturing the health ecosystem has become an immediate priority especially preventive and immunity building. Also it has to be acknowledged that the dream of Universal Health Coverage is impossible without mainstreaming of Ayurveda healthcare. So there is a need to support, encourage and accelerate accessibility to authentic doctors, good quality medicine development, modern technology solutions and digitization in this field. For the past few years the Government of India has done a lot to promote Ayurveda. Still a lot needs to be achieved and fast. The right provisions in the Union Budget would give boost to the Ayurvedic Healthcare ecosystem. Waiving off or reduction in GST from the current 12% on Ayurvedic medicines would promote the consumption of natural medicines and sustainable healthcare. Allocation of budget for overall development of a future ready healthcare ecosystem which has world class Ayurvedic medical research, development of world class institutions, development of innovative technology solutions and; medicine research and development is desired. We hope that the Union Budget would include focused approach towards accelerating the development of holistic Ayurveda science. Being one of the core sectors of the economy, the real estate sector is still waiting to be granted infrastructure status. We expect this year’s Budget to increase the tax limit or increase the limit of the property value so that savings on taxation gets increased and the real estate sector gets more attention of buyers. The Indian logistics sector has grown by leaps and bounds and will play the role of enabler in achieving the goal of becoming the world's third largest economy by 2030. As we enter the new normal of post-pandemic businesses, and scaling up of domestic manufacturing, the logistics sector requires major investment from the government in infrastructure building. Expressways, warehousing hubs, inland waterways as well as dedicated freight corridors are some of the major and urgent infrastructural needs that will support the manufacturing and retail sectors. Greater funding has to be provided for rural connectivity, and setting up of technology-driven logistics operations across the country. Automation of various paper-based processes, funding support for adoption of EVs by transporters and simplification of business processes are some of the other major improvements that we expect the government to pay attention to, in the upcoming budget. “As we enter the third year of the pandemic, we have learned a great deal about the COVID19 disease and the virus. However, one thing that we still haven't learned is that indefinite school closures, especially without any plans of an alternate form of education for vulnerable children, is not an option. Indian schools for primary children have been closed for more than 600 days! There are multiple reports which peg this to be around 3-4 years worth of learning loss for children. Some studies, like the one by the Asian Development Bank, have also shown how this is going to affect the future incomes of our children. ""During the pandemic, medical diagnostics emerged as the first line of disease containment and the most important public health measure. The World Health Organization's T3: Test. Treat. Track. initiative to combat COVID-19 has brought diagnostics to the forefront, emphasizing the growing need for better testing capabilities and the importance of quality. People have begun to understand the importance and needs of molecular/genetic testing, and it has invariably resulted in increased investments by large private labs and establishment of more RT PCR labs across the country. In this sense, the government's collaboration with the private sector, while refocusing on life science, healthcare, and diagnostics, will play a critical role in deciding the future of diagnostics in the country. Indian agriculture has proved its resilience by achieving a 3.4% growth despite the raucous pandemic. The forthcoming budget must look to leverage the resilience to enable the growth of agriculture by more than 4%  in the coming few years, while being more environmentally responsible. There are certain crucial aspects to be considered for this transformation. Setting up a National Agriculture Council  on the lines of GST council, comprising of centre and state representatives along with the representatives of the private Food and Agriculture sector to drive long term strategy can prove to be the stepping stone. Incentivising access to formal banking and financial services basis good loan repayment practices will help in uplifting the current state by means of enhancing the credit availability to agriculture to beyond Rs. 18 Lakh Crore at affordable interest rates for farmers and farm level processing infrastructure, instead of being consumed by corporates. Alongside, incentivising the private sector players in agriculture who handhold the formation and growth of FPOs/FPCs by offering tax breaks on such substantiated investments can be beneficial in the longer run. Further, upgrading the quality control infrastructure across the country to ensure availability of quality inputs to farmers and agriculture produce to processors and consumers will strengthen the backbone of Indian agriculture. Ethiopia announced completion of third filling of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) despite concerns raised by Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia’s govt 11 Aug said it had launched power production from GERD’s second turbine, next day announced completion of dam’s third filling.

Claiming that Chinese build-up in Doklam is threatening the strategic “Siliguri Corridor” — the gateway to northeastern states — the party asked when the nation will have “China pe charcha”. “The nation wants to know…why are you insisting that there should be no debate in Parliament on the border situation and the challenges we face from China,” he asked. “Chinese build-up in Doklam up to ‘Jampheri Ridge’ is threatening India’s strategic ‘Siliguri Corridor’ — the gateway to Northeastern States! This is of utmost concern for our National Security! @narendramodi ji, When will the nation have… ‘CHINA PE CHARCHA’?” Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge tweeted, in a swipe at Prime Minister Modi’s campaign initiative “chai pe charcha”. The Congress on Saturday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not allowing a discussion in Parliament on the situation along the border with China and asked why he was not taking the nation into confidence in the matter. Chinese build-up in Doklam upto “Jampheri Ridge” is threatening India’s strategic “Siliguri Corridor” — the gateway to Northeastern States! In a statement in Parliament, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said Chinese troops tried to “unilaterally” change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Yangtse area of Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang sector on December 9, but the Indian Army compelled them to retreat with its “firm and resolute” response. “You have met the top Chinese leadership an unprecedented 18 times and recently shook hands with Xi Jinping in Bali. China launched an incursion into Tawang shortly thereafter and continues to unilaterally alter the border situation. Why are you not taking the nation into confidence?” the Congress leader asked. Congress general secretary communications Jairam Ramesh said in a statement that it is the political duty and moral responsibility of the prime minister to share his “mann ki baat” on the seven questions posed to him by his party.

Joining the issue, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said: “This Corona aggression has come from China to India; at the borders, the Chinese troops have done the aggression; and now there is hybrid warfare. Is the government aware of it?” He asked for a statement. “What will happen to our national security? The IT minister is here. Please tell us what’s happening.” Explained | China is watching — Hybrid warfare: What data they collect, why it’s cause for concern Taking up the matter with the Chinese Ambassador, the Government Wednesday set up an expert committee under the National Cyber Security Coordinator to study the revelations in China Watching, an investigation by The Indian Express, that a Shenzen-based company, with links to the Chinese government, is monitoring over 10,000 Indian individuals and entities. Explained | Could war with India be an attempt to restore Xi’s shaky political position in China? During Zero Hour, the Congress raised China’s “hybrid warfare” and its “watching on Indians” in the Lok Sabha. Raising the issue, Kodikkunnil Suresh called it a “cyber war,” and “direct attempt of information espionage and aggression by China.” Top sources told The Indian Expressthat the key driver behind the decision to take note of this revelation is that the issues it raises, of data security and privacy, are similar to the ones that prompted the government’s ban on Chinese apps. “What we have come to know of Zhenhua’s project validates our concerns about Chinese mobile apps,” said an official. Referring to the ongoing investigation by The Indian Express– its fourth part is being published Wednesday — Jaishankar said the matter was taken up by the Ministry of External Affairs with the Chinese Ambassador today. Congress MP from Ernakulam Hibi Eden gave a notice for adjournment motion to Speaker Om Birla. The notice called for a wider debate on “our security architecture” and said that the “credentials of our national security are being mocked by this Chinese firm…Such snooping should be nipped in the bud so that our sovereign rights are protected.” The Speaker, however, said he would not allow the adjournment motion. This was conveyed by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a letter to Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP K C Venugopal who raised the issue in Rajya Sabha today. “Our Embassy in Beijing also raised it with the Foreign Ministry of China. The Chinese side conveyed that Shenzen Zhenhua is a private company and had stated its position publicly. On their part, the Chinese Foreign Ministry maintained that there was no connection between the company concerned and the Chinese government,” Jaishankar said. ""It's difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity,"" Biden said at a press conference after the meeting when asked to what extent he believed China has the ability to talk Pyongyang out of conducting a test. (Reuters) ➡️ Europe will engage with China but needs to ""rebalance"" the relationship to avoid becoming too reliant on the country for areas like innovative technology, European Council President Charles Michel said. ➡️ South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol called for China to play a bigger role in reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations, his office said, after talks with Xi. Meanwhile, PM Modi partook in several bilateral talks on the sidelines of the summit and was photographed while speaking to Chinese President Xi Jinping, a first since the Galwan Valley incident. Other world leaders in attendance included US President Joe Biden, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. ➡️Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised ""serious concerns"" over suspected domestic interference by China in his first talks with President Xi on Tuesday in more than three years, a Canadian government source said.

In a session on digital transformation, the prime minister said the principle of 'data for development' will be an integral part of the overall theme of India's upcoming G-20 Presidency. As India was handed over the presidency of the G20, the Congress on Wednesday alleged that the grouping's summit in 2023 will be milked by ""the world's greatest event manager"" for the Lok Sabha elections, an apparent jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Praveen Chakravarty, head of the Congress’s technology and data cell, said, “The news about Chinese digital surveillance of India’s leaders and others is quite disturbing. Most importantly, we need to know the extent of this surveillance, and if there is more to this than collating public data on people. The government has to assure the nation through a detailed investigation.” TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said: “I moved an adjournment motion in Parliament today regarding this issue of the Chinese company tracking us, although I did not get a chance to mention it. This is an extremely serious matter that a Chinese agency, controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government, is farming data information on all top political leaders, senior officials, Army staff and top scientists. It is invading the data privacy of Indian leaders. Our government needs to raise this concern with the Chinese government.” In its official reaction, Congress communication department in-charge Randeep Surjewala said, “If the report is true, then was the Modi government aware of this serious case? Or they didn’t know that we were being spied upon? Why is the government failing to protect our borders over and over again? A clear message needs to be sent out to China to prevent them from indulging in such activities.” EDITORIAL | Strategic targeting by Chinese firm raises questions that need to be understood — before being addressed Gaurav Gogoi, Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha, said, “We want the Government of India to step up its efforts on cyber security because when we confront a country like China — we are confronting China not only on land, sea and air, we are confronting Chinese intentions in cyberspace as well — Government of India should not be caught sleeping.” The Congress said the report about “Chinese digital surveillance” of India’s leaders and others is “quite disturbing” and it is important to know the extent of this surveillance, and if there is more to this than collating data. It said the development has huge implications for national security and privacy of citizens. Taking note of The Indian Express investigation report that a Shenzen-based technology company with links to the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party is monitoring over 10,000 Indian individuals and organisations in its global database of “foreign targets”, Opposition members asked the government Monday to step in, open a probe and take the initiative for a global dialogue. SP Rajya Sabha member Kunwar Rewati Raman Singh said, “This (the investigation) is a warning for India… We must remember that China captured a large part of Indian territory in the 1962 war… China is transgressing on our territory again. How much Indian land has been captured, the government is not telling us.” READ | Express Investigation Part-2: New economy under Chinese watch — Tech start-ups, range of apps from payment to healthcare Referring to the military standoff with China, he said, “Right now, we can express our immediate concern with our neighbour because of the existing circumstances, but I think this is a larger problem that needs to be handled globally, and I am sure we are well placed to take an initiative in this matter. The government should take initiative for a global dialogue.” The source, however, did not answer specific queries if the Chinese government and the military were clients of Zhenhua Data as claimed by the company, or to what purpose the Chinese government used the OKIDB data, if it did. It has entries from United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Arab Emirates, was obtained through a network of researchers from a source connected to the company based in Shenzhen City in Guangdong province, south-east China. When a correspondent visited the Shenzhen headquarters of Zhenhua Data and presented a list of questions which included those from The Indian Express, a company staffer, who declined to offer her name, said: “Sorry, these questions touch upon our trade secrets. It’s not convenient to disclose.” This assumes significance when an increasingly assertive China is locked in a simmering standoff with India along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh and is pushing against many of its neighbours in the region and beyond. Indeed, Zhenhua claims it works with Chinese intelligence, military and security agencies. Working through a professor in Vietnam, Christopher Balding, who has taught in Shenzhen, the source shared data with news organisations that include The Indian Express, The Australian Financial Review, Italy’s Il Foglio and The Daily Telegraph, London. “Every country does this in one way or the other, that’s the job of foreign intelligence. But using big data science and technology, Beijing has, clearly, taken it to the next level,” said Robert Potter, a Canberra-based cyber security, tech and data expert, who worked with the source to verify the electronic antecedents of the Zhenhua data set. But responding to questions from The Indian Express, a Chinese Embassy source in Delhi said, “China has not asked and will not ask companies or individuals to collect or provide data, information and intelligence stored within other countries’ territories for the Chinese government by installing “backdoors” or by violating local laws.” Calling itself a pioneer in using big data for “hybrid warfare” and the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” a Shenzen-based technology company with links to the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party, is monitoring over 10,000 Indian individuals and organisations in its global database of “foreign targets,” an investigation by The Indian Express has revealed. “What I would like to point out is that the Chinese government has been asking Chinese companies to strictly abide by local laws and regulations when doing business overseas; this position will not change,” the Embassy source said. Those from the news media named in the list include: N Ravi, who was last week named The Hindu Group chairman; Zee News Editor-in-Chief Sudhir Chaudhary; India Today Group Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai; former media advisor in the Prime Minister’s Office Sanjaya Baru; and The Indian Express Chief Editor Raj Kamal Jha. The Delhi High Court Wednesday sought the Centre’s stand in a PIL seeking a direction to the Union Government to establish the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) as the “national standards body of India” in respect of “television audience measurement services”. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh Thursday said: ""We have just received information that the Prime Minister has called an emergency meeting to review the situation of Covid. And PM's B team — Delhi CM — has also called a meeting to review Covid situation. Aap chronology samjhiye."" The Delhi High Court sought on Wednesday the response of the Centre, Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) and Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) to a petition seeking to establish BIS as the national standards body for harmonious development of activities related to Television Audience Measurement Services. The move comes amid a spurt in Covid cases in China.

The panel has sought the details related to the FIR and the arrest of the accused by December 26. The chargesheet, filed before a special judge at Rouse Avenue district court, has relied on the statement of Indospirits MD Sameer Mahendru, who is an accused in the alleged money laundering case, to allege that he was approached by members of the ‘South group’. It is alleged that they expressed an interest in his company, and his initial pushback against this partnership fizzled out after a promise by AAP communications in-charge Vijay Nair to provide him with a wholesale business.

Kanhaiya Kumar, speaking at a press conference in Pakhal, Faridabad on the third day of the Bharat Jodo Yatra in Haryana, said that the BJP is wasting time attacking Congress. “Since the day yatra began, BJP has been attacking the Congress by raising bogus issues. The first attack is when BJP says Bharat toh juda hai, so why is the yatra required. I want to counter and ask why is BJP talking about yatra if Bharat is United. Why is the Health Minister wasting ink by writing letter to suspend the yatra? Agar zaroorat nhi yatra ki toh charcha kyon?” he said. Gandhi shared the statements put out by the Indian and Chinese Foreign Ministries after the talks between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. He also highlighted how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of People’s Republic of China in its statement made a mention of the Galwan Valley, but the Indian External Affairs Ministry did not do so. “Respected Prime Minister, do you remember your words? Do your words mean anything? Will you tell us why our forces are retracting from our land? The country seeks answers,” Surjewala tweeted. Seeking an answer from PM Modi as to why Indian soldiers were withdrawn from their own land, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala reminded him of his own words in 2013 during UPA’s regime Gandhi also shared a media report which showed some Ladakhis alleging that the Chinese have been occupying Indian territory in Ladakh. “Patriotic Ladakhis are raising their voice against Chinese intrusion. They are screaming a warning. Ignoring their warning will cost India dearly,” the former Congress president tweeted. “For India’s sake, please listen to them,” he had said. The Congress Wednesday dug out an old tweet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. On Wednesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had asked the government why status quo ante was not insisted upon by New Delhi and why the territorial sovereignty of the Galwan Valley does not find mention in the government’s statement. “National interest is paramount. Government of India’s duty is to protect it. Then, Why has Status Quo Ante not been insisted on? Why is China allowed to justify the murder of 20 unarmed jawans in our territory? Why is there no mention of the territorial sovereignty of Galwan valley?” he asked on Twitter. On Saturday, Rahul Gandhi had said patriotic Ladakhis are raising their voice against Chinese intrusion and asked the government to listen to them, asserting that ignoring their warning will cost India dearly. “Rahul had been discussing the China issue with me for a long time, and had been concerned about the matter even while the Central government was vehemently denying any stand-off in Galwan,“ Amarinder Singh said. Coming out in support of Rahul Gandhi, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday took strong exception to BJP president JP Nadda’s attack on Rahul over the India-China standoff issue, and trashed it as a brazen attempt to distract public attention from the Government of India’s failure in Galwan Valley. A new survey in India examines public opinion on domestic politics and national security issues to understand the political incentives leaders face during interstate crises in Southern Asia. This survey reveals how public attitudes could shape Indian diplomacy, crisis escalation, and nuclear force development. The nature of popular views on these topics and their effects on elite decision-making are understudied. Understanding those incentives would help the United States and other diplomatic partners of India clarify mutual expectations and promote regional stability. The survey was intended to measure Indian attitudes towards the current government, India’s domestic challenges, and inter-state disputes as part of a broader Stimson Center initiative to understand the political incentives leaders face during interstate crises in southern Asia.1  Note: Also see Christopher Clary, Sameer Lalwani, and Niloufer Siddiqui, “Public Opinion and Crisis Behavior in a Nuclearized South Asia,” International Studies Quarterly 65, no. 4 (2021): 1064-1076.     This nationally representative survey was translated and fielded in 12 languages for respondents in all 28 Indian states and 6 of India’s 8 union territories by the Centre for Voting Opinion & Trends in Election Research (CVoter).2  Note: The survey was fielded in English, Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Oriya, Bangla and Asamiya. Given their small population size, the survey had no respondents in Lakshadweep or Andaman and Nicobar Islands union territories.    CVoter is a widely used public opinion firm that regularly partners with Indian newspapers, magazines, television news channels, as well as academic researchers.3  Note: See, inter alia, ABP Live, “Are Voters Satisfied With Work Done By Govt In Poll-Bound States?

While there have been accusations of bias on electoral predictions, a recent analysis found its polling is reasonably comparable in predicting winners and margins of victory (“Indian pollsters are doing fine. Here is how forecasts work,” March 27, 2022.)     This project note outlines the key descriptive findings from the survey.4Note: With an overall sample size of 7,052, a conservative 95% confidence interval on categorical responses is 1.2 percentage points for the whole survey. Because this article uses subgroup analysis, the subgroup-specific 95% confidence intervals are displayed in the figures. The nature of Indian public opinion on national security issues and the effect of mass views on elite decision-making—which together determine the foreign policy “accountability environment”—remains remarkably understudied.20  Note: Vipin Narang & Paul Staniland, “Democratic Accountability and Foreign Security Policy: Theory and Evidence from India,” Security Studies, 27 (3), 2018, pp. 410-447.    Yet our survey identifies several areas where public views may shape Indian government preferences in ways that will be important for India’s diplomatic partners to understand. Several implications appear most prominent from our analysis. Respondents were divided about whether other countries would come to India’s defense in the event of an international conflict. A majority of respondents said that the United States would “definitely” or “probably” help in the event of an Indian war with China (56 percent) or Pakistan (59 percent), with a remaining large minority skeptical of U.S. aid in such scenarios. In contrast, surveys of U.S. respondents have found sizeable majorities might prefer to avoid entanglement in a Sino-Indian military conflict.16  Note: Vasabjit Banerjee and Timothy S. Rich. “Which side would the US public choose in an India-China conflict?,” The Interpreter, July 30, 2020, https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/which-side-would-us-public-choose-india-china-conflict.    For their part, Indian military leaders and strategists have stressed that India will have to fight its own wars alone without counting on others.17  Note: Asian News International (ANI), “India Has To Fight Its Own Wars, US Deployments According To Their Perspective: IAF Chief,” BW Businessworld, October 5, 2020, https://www.businessworld.in/article/India-has-to-fight-its-own-wars-US-deployments-according-to-their-perspective-IAF-Chief/05-10-2020-328212/; “Explained Ideas: Why India can’t depend on the US and EU to counter China,” The Indian Express, June 29, 2020, https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-china-border-dispute-the-ue-eu-6477314/; Kartik Bommakanti, “American military support to India is not automatic in China-India war. Delhi must know it,” The Print, July 22, 2020, https://theprint.in/opinion/american-military-support-to-india-is-not-automatic-in-china-india-war-delhi-must-know-it/466196/. A similar majority of Indian respondents assessed China would come to Pakistan’s aid in the event of an Indo-Pakistani war (56 percent) and that Pakistan would come to China’s aid in the event of a Sino-Indian war (59 percent) consistent with Indian strategists’ fears of a “two-front war.” Combining these results shows that a large minority of respondents, roughly 4 in 10, foresee a scenario where India might have to fight both China and Pakistan simultaneously without U.S. help.

As Opposition leader, his biggest challenge is to retain and consolidate the party’s organisational base in Maharashtra, especially at a time when the BJP has to fight the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena coalition government in the state. There has been speculation about the BJP shifting him to the Centre. Leaders across the political spectrum are on his speed dial. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh recently appointed him as his principal advisor. The revival of the state economy after the pandemic will be his top priority. The party has also begun work for the civic polls. How he handles the current Mumbai Police crisis may strain the coalition and test his leadership."

(PTI) The Aam Aadmi Party Sunday asked Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to deploy the state police for the security of farmers protesting at Delhi borders against the three new Central laws. In a letter to Singh on Sunday, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the Punjab Police must provide protection to farmers so that no harm is done to them and they can continue to protest against the 'black farm laws' in a peaceful manner.

In the aftermath of violence at Singhu border, farmers have stepped up “internal security” — from increased vigils to checkpoints — to prevent any untoward incident and ensure “political agents” do not get a chance to incite violence again. The BJP has long predicted it would retain the state because of policies such as free staples for the poor during the pandemic, a crackdown on crime, and its popularity among the Hindu majority reinforced by the construction of a temple on the site of a razed mosque. I felt very happy on reading about how a local vegetable market in Boinpalli of Hyderabad is fulfilling its responsibility. All of us have seen that in vegetable markets, a lot of produce gets spoilt for a variety of reasons. The vegetables spread all around, it spreads filth too, but the vegetable market of Boinpalli decided that it will not throw away the leftover vegetables just like that. People associated with the vegetable market decided that they will generate electricity from this. You may have hardly heard of generating electricity from waste vegetables – this is the power of innovation. Today in Boinpalli vegetable market what was once a waste, wealth is getting created from that – this is the journey of creation of wealth from waste. Nearly 10-tonnes of waste is generated there every day, which is collected in a plant. In this plant 500-units of electricity is generated every day, and about 30 Kilos of bio fuel too is generated. The vegetable market is illuminated through this electricity and the bio fuel that is generated is used to cook food in the market canteen – isn’t it a wonderful effort!

Are you saying China has right to build infra till border but india can’t do viceversa? When India builds infra (roads etc..) till border whats china’s problem? I dont think india will invade and occupy aksai chin..thats  not a possibility. India is building roads in border areas which fall under their sovereignty Again, all what I was saying is:1: Contrary to what many Indians think, China has no intention of grabbing any land currently under India’s control from India. All China wants is to maintain the status quo in place ever since the end of the 1962 war.2: When demarcation of borderlines between China and India is till up in the air and a trust deficit which shows no signs of abating ,  any unilateral move by one party in the area will be deemed by the opposing party as a threat to upend the status quo and will be met with  commensurate counter measures from the other side. This is true for both China and India. Once Hindu leaders have agreed to partition, then you abide by the rules : only the connected Muslim majority areas  in NW and NE could go to Pakistan.   Hyderabad was land locked, and it was correct to integrate that into India, especially since the majority were Hindu.  Likewise, it was logical for Kashmir to be part of Pakistan.   It was folly to take Kashmir – it cannot be integrated, they will fight a guerrilla war and there is no way India can beat that.  No country had won against a guerrilla war. I did not advocate India should be partitioned, I said the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha threatened Muslims in the 1930s with the Hitler model (like they do now in front of our eyes), and hence partition became inevitable. Only way to prevent a Mad fellow from acting Mad, is to threaten  him with double madness.  So long as Pakistan demands Kashmir, India does not have any alternative but to demand POK back.  Ever heard the saying ” office is the best form of defense “ Read the RSS’s own writings.  Golwalkar wrote praise of Hitler and his Jewish policy, and wished for the same in India.  The CAA-NRC is just that.   You cannot fool the world.    The time is coming when RSS and Hindus will be profiled.  I believe the tweets of BJP Hindus have triggered off profiling in UAE and Gulf, and it is a matter of time, before it gets to the west. Which brings us to ourselves, India. We are philosophically, ideologically and constitutionally committed not just to defending the borders that exist in reality, but reclaiming the ones shown on our map. That’s why what each country sees as a dream borders on the fantasy. I dare not say more on this. Especially when I can lean on the wisdom of a former Navy chief and decorated war hero, Admiral Arun Prakash (Vir Chakra, 1971). Writing in The Indian Express earlier this week, he cautioned that, “As a nation, we need to be pragmatic enough to realise that neither conquest nor re-conquest of territory is possible in the 21st century”. He writes that Parliament should, now, resolve to ask the government, “to establish with utmost urgency, stable, viable and peaceful national boundaries, all around, so that India can proceed, unhindered, with the vital tasks of nation-building and socio-economic development”. Also read: India must believe threat of war is real, even if Chinese build-up is coercive diplomacy Yes he’s trying to defend China’s actions at the stake of his own country. His own brain must be condemning him. While addressing the same event, Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa too stressed the need to resolve the Kashmir dispute through peaceful means, saying: ""We feel it is time to bury the past and move forward."" In his speech at the Islamabad dialogue, Prime Minister Imran said the Kashmir issue was the lone irritant standing in the way of better relations between Pakistan and India. “We are trying, but India would have to take the first step and unless it does that we cannot move ahead,” the premier said while inaugurating the first edition of the Islamabad Security Dialogue. The message, dated March 22, was conveyed to Prime Minister Imran by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad through the Foreign Office."

Also, Adampur near Jalandhar was also close enough to support air operations. Therefore, IAF operated from these three bases. For ground attack, the planes used were namely MiG-2Is, MiG-23s, MiG-27s, Jaguars, and the Mirage-2000. Mainly, for air interception with a secondary role of ground attack, MiG-21 was built. Therefore, it was capable of operating in restricted spaces that were important in the Kargil terrain. The intrusions were detected by the Indian Army between 3 May-12 May. And from 15 May-25 May, 1999, military operations were planned, to their attack locations troops moved, artillery and other equipment were also moved in and the equipment that was necessary is purchased also. In May, 1999, an operation was launched by the Indian Army named 'Operation Vijay'. Now, the Indian troops moved towards the occupied Pakistani positions with air cover provided by aircraft and helicopters."

IGPC-IIMA, an independent think tank with in-house expertise in the area of gold markets shall be a knowledge partner to IFSCA to roll out the International Bullion Exchange successfully. IGPC-IIMA is expected to take a top-down approach by setting the broader vision, developing success strategies, and creating the operating guidelines for the seamless functioning of the IBE. Shri. Injeti Srinivas, Chairperson of IFSCA said, “GIFT IFSC is an emerging global financial services hub that is being built on India’s strength in technology and intellectual prowess in the area of financial markets; it is intended to leverage the advantages of both the size and potential of the Indian economy and that of Indian diaspora. International Bullion Exchange at IFSC is an initiative on lines that fits into the vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister to make IFSC a global hub for financial services activities. IBE is intended to strike an equilibrium in order to reduce the market inefficiencies that currently exist in the Indian bullion trade. Thus this move would go on to integrate precious metals trade with financial markets, and create a transparent platform for bullion trading. Through this IBE aims to achieve efficient price discovery, quality and services that are on par with international standards.” At the Union Budget 2020 the Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman announced that India shall soon have an International Bullion Exchange (IBE) at the International Finance Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City, Gandhinagar, Gujarat.

West also met Dr. Abdullah. 5 Finally, we have seen a progression in the back channel talks between India and Pakistan, and apart from the transit trade negotiated, seen other movements, especially since the new government came into power. PM Modi greeted the Pakistan PM in a rare exchange, the ceasefire line continues to be maintained, and in the past month 2 Pakistani delegations, one on regional terror and one on the Indus Water talks visited Delhi. Now the question is, will better ties with the Taliban be welcomed by the Military establishment in Pakistan, or not? Speaking to The Hindu, Taliban spokesperson Sohail Shaheen said it had been raised, and the Taliban is willing to give security guarantees for an Indian mission. And remember Afghanistan still maintains an Embassy in Delhi, which regularly interacts with the government in Delhi. The M.E.A. said that the visit was about humanitarian assistance. In a statement announcing the visit, its said that the team, led by Jt Secretary JP Singh and consisting of a number of diplomatic and security officials met with Mr. Mottaqi and also toured India-funded facilities like the Chimtala power plant, a hospital and a school. 4 And then NSA Doval travelled to Dushanbe where he spoke of the situation in Afghanistan- saying very significantly that it was the duty of regional countries “to enhance the capability of Afghanistan to counter terrorism and terrorist groups which pose a threat to regional peace and security”, something that was read as India’s willingness to distinguish between those in control of Afghanistan and terror groups there. 1 The government’s Central Asian outreach- that began with a National Security Advisor’s conference on Afghanistan, held in Delhi in November, the FM conference in December and the PM’s virtual summit with Central Asian leaders in January- all of which pitched for a stronger engagement with Afghanistan, particularly given the triple threats of terrorism, drugs, and refugees emanating from there. 1 The Taliban Reader: War, Islam and Politics in their own Words by Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuhen 2 With the ice broken, it is clear that more such visits are being planned- with Mr. Singh, who had earlier attended the start of Taliban-Afghan talks in Doha and then met with Taliban Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi in Moscow last year, as a quasi special envoy 4 Another book I’ve recommended that is coming out in paperback-The Afghanistan Papers: A Secret History of the War by Craig Whitlock and the Washington Post. When asked about whether the visit and official talks mean a softening of stand by India towards the Taliban government, however here is what the M.E.A. spokesperson said, indicating that the government is still shy of acknowledging that it is opening up ties with the Taliban. Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi will chair the meeting to be attended by China, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, according to Foreign Office. The evolving situation in Afghanistan and its implications on regional security dominated the conversation at separate meetings that the top Indian leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, held with visiting Russian NSA Nikolay Patrushev and CIA chief William J Burns. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday held ""useful discussions"" with Russia's Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev on the situation in Afghanistan. Patrushev met Jaishankar after holding wide-ranging talks with NSA Ajit Doval with a focus on possible security threats to the region from the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. (PTI) Burns, who is meeting NSA Ajit Doval and top brass in the intelligence and security establishment, is discussing the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan. He arrived in the national capital on Tuesday, sources said. CIA chief William J Burns is in Delhi for consultations with the top Indian leadership, especially in the security and strategic establishment, sources said on Wednesday. A Russian government statement said that following up on the telephone conversation between Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 24, an “exchange of views took place on the military, political and socio-economic situation in Afghanistan” at Patrushev’s meetings on Wednesday. (Read more) The two diplomats are first set to talk bilaterally and later hold a virtual meeting with other foreign ministers, the German foreign ministry said in a statement. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday that China is ready to maintain communication with the new government and leader in Afghanistan. According to AP, the German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement that his country is ready to provide humanitarian aid via the United Nations and will continue to speak to the Taliban to secure the departure from Afghanistan of former employees and others. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet at the Ramstein US Air Base for talks on Afghanistan on Wednesday. “The group has also been monitoring the ground situation in Afghanistan and international reactions,” said a source familiar with the Government of India’s response to the evolving crisis in Afghanistan where the last U.S. aircraft left earlier on Tuesday morning. According official sources, the resolution, which called on the Taliban to keep its commitments on preventing terror groups in Afghanistan and urged them to assist the safe evacuations of all Afghan nationals wishing to leave the country, was the result of careful coordination and “high-level official contacts with UNSC members, including a call to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the efforts were overseen by a special new group led by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. Sources said that a high-level group consisting of Mr. Jaishankar, Mr. Doval and senior officials set up by Mr. Modi, are now focused on developments in Afghanistan, ensuring the evacuation of stranded Indians and also airlifting Afghan nationals, especially “religious minority groups” from Kabul. India is expected to chair the 1988 Sanctions committee that looks at Taliban sanctions next and participate in the decision to extend the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), where it will also have to balance competing demands from the U.S., the U.K. and France bloc ranged against Russia and China. “The adoption of the resolution is a strong signal from the Security Council and the international community on its expectations in respect of Afghanistan,” Mr. Shringla told the media after the resolution was passed. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s travel plans in September will be watched closely, as he has been invited to attend the SCO summit in Dushanbe, of countries including Russia, China, Pakistan and Central Asian states on September 16-17, as well as the Quad summit in Washington, including the U.S., Australia and Japan, expected to be held on September 26-27. In their statements explaining the split within the UNSC’s permanent members, Russia and China said they wanted all the groups, especially Islamic State (ISIL) and the Uighur East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) be named specifically in the document, and listed a number of objections to the drafting of the resolution. They accused the resolution’s sponsors the U.S., the U.K. and France of having rushed it through on a “tight schedule” while seeking to absolve the U.S. of responsibility, and distinguish between “their and our terrorists”. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla at the UNSC meeting. China’s U.N. Ambassador Gueng Shang also complained that the resolution was not “balanced” and had been “forcefully pushed” through. Even so, neither country vetoed the resolution. According to sources, another resolution in September, as the situation in Afghanistan becomes clearer and after the Irish Ambassador takes over, the presidency is expected to be debated as well. Today, China will host the trilateral dialogue with foreign minister of Pakistan , Shah Mehmood Qureshi , Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will preside over the trilateral dialogue . This time , if China joins hands with Pakistan on Kashmir, it would be a critical situation . In 1989 when Soviet troops were out of Afghanistan , Pakistan had diverted terrorists, terrorism machinery toward Kashmir . That fact cannot be forgotten nor ignored . China is hosting fourth- China- Afghanistan – Pakistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue on Thursday in search of what is being described as an interest in peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan.. This may appear to be a sincere effort of China to help Afghanistan find peace and stability that it had been missing for so long that the country has become synonymous with the larger-than-life size trouble spot of the world where even the most powerful country like America has given up and has started packing its bags back home. The US government appointed a veteran diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad its special representative for Afghanistan on September 21, 2018 , to start the diplomatic process and bring Taliban to table . That he did by negotiating with Taliban in Doha, Qatar and also after meeting government officials in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Gulf countries . This resulted into what was touted as a big success but now it all but failed as Taliban has not reduced its violence level . Its aggressive designs are continuing . The failure of the mission of US’ special representative has come as a boon to China. The Chinese agenda is clear it wants to exploit the uncertainties that have swamped Afghanistan with what it calls “ the unilateral withdrawal at the critical stage of peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan.” It has concluded , as Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin spelled out at press briefing on Wednesday , that apart from this act of the US withdrawal has brought uncertainties in Afghanistan’s domestic situation and regional security landscape .”"

Yes. I can join any other college or hospital; there is no restriction by the Medical Council of India. But I want my job back. I am unable to travel abroad unless I obtain permission from the court. But then (if I go away), who will fight the fight? Somebody has to speak up. Everybody can’t remain silent spectators. Somebody has to speak up against the atrocities, the injustice. How were you able to get your tell-all book published? The State government now started a departmental inquiry against Dr Khan for allegedly spreading misinformation about the probe report and making anti-government remarks during his suspension. Later, Dr Khan told reporters that in 2017 Adityanath had told him “I will see you” [as a warning]. As for the speech for which Sharjeel was booked, organisations in JNU released a statement where he stated that he was highlighting the method of Shaheen Bagh roadblock and was suggesting the same for raising the concerns of people in Assam. “I was saying we should try to peacefully block roads wherever possible. In that context, I said you have to block roads going to Assam. It was basically a call for chakka jam.” According to the statement, his speech was taken out of context and misinterpreted by media friendly to the Sangh Parivar and the BJP spokesperson in order to target him with false propaganda. “The fascist spin doctors are now conflating his call for chakka jam as a cry fortukde tukde of India. This is in line with the government’s continuous attempt at suppressing of assertive Muslim voices in the anti-CAA protests across the country,” said the statement. A court in Aligarh granted him bail on February 10, but the jail authorities kept delaying his release. After his lawyer, Irfan Ghazi, filed an application with the Chief Judicial Magistrate, his release order was dispatched with a messenger directing the jailor to expedite his release. Yet he was detained, illegally and in contempt of court, for another three days. Then the NSA was invoked against him, ensuring that he does not step out of prison. Now, suddenly both the platforms are not reachable. OpIndia has reached out to Bilal Zaidi, cofounder of Crowdnewsing as well as OurDemocracy. We shall update the report once we hear back from him. One of the platforms used by TMC leader Saket Gokhale to raise funds for his ‘sustenance’ as he filed Rs 10 RTI full time while not holding on to a regular day job, was ‘OurDemocracy.in’. In November 2019, Gokhale tweeted a link to his crowdfunding platform asking people to cough up money because he chose to give up his ‘cushy job’ to ‘fight the BJP/RSS’, which he usually did with filing frivolous RTIs which cost Rs 10. He urged other Modi haters to assemble and pay him so he can pay his bills and not have to take up a regular job. Anand Mangnale had then admitted to having ‘infiltrated’ a WhatsApp group to ‘keep students safe’. Anand was seen asking members of the group that some people in support of JNU are coming to the main gate, should we do something there? The chilling message was from a group called ‘Unity against Left’, thereby implying that the sender of the message was ‘against Left’ and hence by default ABVP, the students arm of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Priyanka held brainstorming sessions, based on which she restructured the party organization in the State. Soon after the Lok Sabha elections, Priyanka undertook an intensive tour and personal meetings with the people of Uttar Pradesh. Khan also addressed the speculation around his political ambitions, especially in relation to photo-ops with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav in the past. ""I am not joining any party, but I do believe that good people, young people, should join, especially those who can change the system that is becoming so corrupt now,"" he said. With this statement, Khan added a caveat. ""I will, however, ensure that Baba (Yogi Adityanath) goes back to what he was doing five years ago. I ask the people: what development have they seen in the last five years? We should talk about roti, kapda, makaan, health, education, and employment. But this Chief Minister only talks about Ali, Bajrang Bali, Shamshaan, Kabristaan, and Abbajaan. This has to change,"" he said. Khan said that his ambition, right now, was ""Mission Smile hospital, a pediatric hospital with no billing counter."" We have seen slow, sometimes invisible attempts by the Congress party to empathise with the Muslims and Dalits. It organised a signature campaign for the release of Dr. Kafeel Khan and has given him sanctuary in Rajasthan at its own cost. Its leaders went to the homes of those arrested for having participated in the anti CAA protests. But then, soon after, Rahul Gandhi went to Dadri to sympathise with the family of Akhlaq who was lynched by the forces of the popular mandate. Some of his party men disclosed that top functionaries of the Congress had disapproved of the visit. They felt it was bad optics for Rahul to be seen sharing the grief of a Muslim. Rahul Gandhi being detained by the police on his way to Hathras on October 1. Photo: Special arrangement After Dadri came 2016, when the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University were attacked and arrested. The government and media went after Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Anirban, Naga. Rahul Gandhi again went to JNU to express his solidarity with the embattled university and students. This visit also led to a lot of chest beating in the party. A Congress leader told me that gloom had enveloped the party. So I am writing this today to highlight a shameful condition and prick the nationâs now-dead conscience. In a sense, I am writing to cash a cheque. Those who reckon that Muslims needed to blow off steam over NRC-and CAA, and will be content now that the protests are over, will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in India until the Citizenship Amendment Act is revoked and the atrocities against Muslims come to an end. Work hard to reclaim your Constitution knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. So we have come to cash this cheque â a cheque that will give us upon demand the riches of the promised freedom, equal opportunity and the security of justice. We are also writing to remind India of the fierce urgency of now. Days after Modi’s speech, then Union Home minister Rajnath Singh said that the party planned to “make provisions of the sedition law more stringent to check anti-national activities,” if it was elected to power for a second term. He argued that such FIRs should not be registered unless cleared by a committee to be constituted by every state government, whose composition should include the chief justice of the high court or a judge designated by him, the leader of the Opposition and the home affairs minister of the state. The Gauhati High Court in Sagolsem Indramani Singh and Ors vs State of Manipur also held that the appropriate sanctioning authority must ensure that there is a proper case to put a party on trial before trial. Similarly, in Union of India vs Samarathmal, the Madhya Pradesh high court held that the sanction granted must show the application of mind and should not be a mechanical process. In the set of challenges being heard at present, the first petition was a public interest litigation (PIL) filed on 21 February 2021 by Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and K L Shukla, two journalists booked for sedition. Hearing the plea, the bench comprising Justices U U  Lalit, Indira Banerjee and K M Joseph of the Supreme Court issued a notice to the government of India, seeking their reply. In the petition to quash the sedition FIR against him, Dua prayed that the apex court issue directions regarding FIRs against media persons with “at least 10 years’ standing”. On 15 July 2021, writ petitions by two Telugu news channels, TV5 and ABN Andhra Jyothi, were tagged to be heard along with Wangkhemcha’s petition, along with the petitions by Vombatkare and the Editors’ Guild. They sought quashing of the “suo moto'' first information report (FIR) registered against them on charges of sedition. In at least one case, the prosecution did not produce the sanction orders before the court. In other words, an accused is made to undergo an entire trial without the necessary sanction order."

The tweet was about Minister of State for Environment Jaydrathsinh Parmar’s visit to Gujarat BJP’s state headquarters. Doshi alleged that an official Twitter handle is doing publicity for BJP. The tweet was later reportedly deleted and currently the Twitter handle is locked. According to the police officer, “Gokhale posted on social media and tweeted claiming a news report by the Gujarat Samachar… Prima facie the news report clippings are fake… Gujarat Samachar has placed on record that they did not publish any such news report. Considering the massive tragedy… and sensitivity of the issue, the complaint was taken… it had potential law and order ramifications. He (Gokhale) is claiming impersonation and we will add sections under IT Act if need be.”Gokhale has been booked under sections 469, 471, 501, and 505 (b) of the IPC. According to police, an FIR was registered on December 1 at the cyber cell for offences of forgery, tweeting defamatory content and fear-mongering under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), after a complaint by Ahmedabad-based Bhalabhai Kothari, who claimed to be a “senior BJP functionary who was disturbed by Gokhale’s tweet”. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh termed Gokhale’s “arrest” as “utterly disgraceful” and said that the act showed that the BJP is trying to build an “autocratic nation”. He also claimed that the BJP’s days at the Centre are numbered. “Fearless, Gokhale stood against the ruling dispensation that trades lives for its own profit. In reaction, panic-stricken @BJP4India got our national spokesperson @SaketGokhale arrested by Gujarat police. It is their (BJP’s) folly to think these acts of intimidation will make us (TMC) to bow down!,” Banerjee tweeted. “I condemn this vindictive attitude. He (Saket) has been arrested because he tweeted against the Prime Minister. People also tweet against me… We are really feeling sorry about the situation,” she said before heading for Pushkar. TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee described the detention as a reaction of a “panic stricken” BJP. TMC will not bow down to such “acts of intimidation”, he said. West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee condemned the BJP government’s “vindictive attitude”. Banerjee, who is visiting Rajasthan, also claimed that Gokhale made no mistake. The PIB fact check Twitter handle called out Gokhale’s tweet the very day and said, “No such RTI response has been given.” On Tuesday morning, the Press Information Bureau tweeted that the information was fake. The First Information Report (FIR) filed against Gokhale in Ahmedabad accused him of forgery and printing defamatory content."

The 40-feet high chariot made of teak wood was parked in a shed on the temple premises. On Saturday night, a six-decade-old wooden chariot of the famous Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple in Antarvedi in East Godavari district was gutted in a fire under mysterious circumstances. Police are awaiting the forensic report in the case. Naidu alleged that he is seeing a pattern in the charring of the chariot at Antarvedi, Bitragunra idols demolition at Pithapuram, attacks on priests at Devarampadu, propagation of other religions under TTD management and the takeover of Simhachalam temple board. However, on Tuesday evening, police arrested 43 protesters for pelting stones at a local church, resulting in some window panes breaking, and also for damaging the compound wall of the church. The century old chariot gutted as miscreants set fire to it in the early hours of September 6, 2020, at Lakshmi Narasimhaseami temple at Antarvedi in East Godavari district. The century-old wooden chariot of the Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Antarvedi area in Sakhinetipalli Mandal in East Godavari district was gutted early on Sunday. Andhra Pradesh Endowments Minister Velampalli Srinivas on Sunday ordered an inquiry, to be headed by the Additional Commissioner, Endowments Department, K.

The century-old wooden chariot of the Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Antarvedi in East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, was destroyed in a fire on Sunday. The chariot, which was kept under a shed was gutted completely after miscreants had reportedly set fire to it.

The fire has now sparked widespread condemnations across the state as opposition parties and Hindu organisations have staged a protest agaibst the YSR Congress-led government. Dr Rangarajan said that last time, when the chariot was similarly targetted in Nellore district, the police had said that some mentally unstable persons were responsible it and now they are saying short-circuit as the reason. There is an organised attempt to attack Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, he added. “At least two persons, believed to be involved in the destruction of the chariot by setting fire to it, have been taken into custody for the investigation by the police,” Assistant Commissioner K Prasad said. Last Saturday night, a six-decade-old wooden chariot of the famous Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Antarvedi in East Godavari district was gutted in a fire under mysterious circumstances. Scenic Antarvedi is located in the lush green Konaseema region of East Godavari district, 57 km south-east of Bhimavaram. The temple is located near the confluence of the mighty Godavari river and the Bay of Bengal on the east coast of India.

On September 5, a six-decade-old, seven-tiered wooden chariot of the famous Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Antarvedi in East Godavari district was gutted in a fire under mysterious circumstances, leading to a spate of protests On 5 September, the 40 feet wooden ratham (chariot) of the famous Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy at Antarvedi in East Godavari district was gutted in a fire under mysterious circumstances. Earlier, in February, the chariot of the Prasanna Venkateshwara Swamy temple was charred in Bitragunta in Nellore district. In January, several idols of Hindu gods and goddesses were damaged in Pithapuram town of East Godavari district where Antarvedi is located. The temple on the Indrakiladri hill on the left bank of river Krishna is a very popular Shaivite shrine in the state. The TDP, BJP, JanaSena parties, and the VHP etc., Hindu organizations are accusing the YSRCP government’s laxity in preserving the Hindu temples and properties as causing such incidents. The procession of the deities on the silver chariot is the main attraction of Ugadi (the Telugu-Kannada new year day) events at the temple. Due to Covid-19, the event was cancelled this year. The decades old chariot got gutted in a fire in September 2020 for unknown reasons, leading to an uproar across the state and prompting the government to hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)."

Prosecutors are investigating the violent arrest of Michel Zecler, who said he was also racially abused by the officers, after CCTV footage of the incident was released. The police watchdog is also investigating. “Violence originated from the protesters’ side and police have to defend the law and protect national treasures,” the deputy head of the Bangkok police, Piya Tavichai, told reporters. Police said on Sunday their actions were in accordance with international standards and that 20 protesters were arrested for breaking public gathering laws and insulting the monarchy. Under the new law, the onus is on the defendant to prove they would not be a national security threat if released on bail. Under Hong Kong’s common law-based legal system, the onus has traditionally been on the prosecution to prove its case. Outside the court, a small number of pro-China protesters shouted “Jail Jimmy Lai for life ... safeguard Hong Kong’s peace” through a loud-hailer. Inside, Lai’s supporters shouted “Hang in there,” and “Add oil,” an encouragement used frequently in Hong Kong."

So, India perforce will have to be more active, and, in my view, this is actually a time to reassert our interest in multilateralism. In India, as my book argues, we are more nationalistic, but Indian nationalism doesn’t say I reject the world or I have a grievance against the world. Indian nationalism actually is deeply interested in the world. It wants the world to think better of India. It wants to be more present in the world. So, we are becoming more global because we are becoming more nationalistic. It’s an interesting difference from a lot of other countries. The bigger you become, and this is also part of the different world as we are not what we were 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. So the entire ecosystem is changing and we are changing autonomously. Now, what that then does is that it produces this world of convergences, of issues where you agree or disagree, of working arrangements. In the foreign policy business, you use this very ugly word, the world of plurilaterals. I remember in a magazine, you had a split screen. The Prime Minister with China’s president and Russia’s president on one side of the screen, and the American president and the Japanese prime minister on the other side. And by the way, this was a photo of the G20. There was a term which I learned as a political science student, which is from this English philosopher called Hobbes. It’s called ‘all against all’. Now, in reality, you don’t have an ‘all against all’ world because there are many things which are restraints. They are tempered by interdependency, by convergence, etc. But there is a high amount of ‘all against all’ kind of behaviour, which is increasing in the world. So sometimes, even with your friends, you are bargaining. There is both a past we need to take into account and a future that we need to sort of cater for. And we happen to be neighbours, and we also happen to be rising approximately in the sort of same parallel timeframe. They have moved earlier than us and in a more sweeping way that I quite accept. So actually, the conversations were about strategic intentions, strategic posture and how do you find accommodation. I think that was quite different from the conversations that I have read because you had fewer conversations in the 50s. There was only one meeting at that time between Nehru and Mao Zedong. There was Zhou Enlai in the middle. But I wouldn’t draw that parallel at all. Honestly, I don’t see any similarity. The Ramnath Goenka Memorial Lecture (2019), in a more expanded form, is one of the chapters of the book. And I call it ‘The Dogmas of Delhi’, since I used that term in the lecture. But what is the book about? I think the starting point would be that it’s a very different world and I can’t emphasise that enough. Because all of us, myself included, we are all creatures of habits, we are creatures of assumptions. So we tend to fall back on that’s how it was before or the last time I did it. This is a human habit. So why I emphasise that it’s a changing world and a different world is because if you look at the players, you look at the weight of the players, you look at the relationship of the players, you look at the idea that what is even a relationship, what is influence, what is power. All of this has changed. Some of it changed gradually, some of it came very suddenly, but you had a series of shocks I would say, which suddenly focused everybody’s mind on what happened in the American presidential election, what happened in Brexit, the consequences of the rise of China and you know, how that is projected outside. Now, I would say in most of the world today, the dangers and the challenges of climate change are appreciated. I acknowledge that this is not unfortunately a universal phenomenon. But, we are very clear on which side of the debate we are on. We are actively leading efforts out there. Regarding the pandemic, there are different directions this is going to go. What the pandemic did immediately was to raise issues of health security, everybody scrambled for masks, and everybody scrambled for PPEs. Then there was a bigger debate, what medicines, where do you go, etc. And, I mean, typically, these are gatherings which are used, as Ambassador knows, to do a lot of bilateral business. The paragraph that the Ambassador quoted (from my book) is to my mind exactly that point I told you, which is, the RIC (Russia-India-China) and JAI (Japan-USA-India) plurilaterals. But, you can have an SCO and a QUAD (Quadrilateral). And this is sort of the complicated world in which we operate and I think our country which masters that, would do itself a great favour. Today, for me, if you look at Bangladesh, and I have repeatedly made this point that if there’s one big neighbourly relationship that has changed in the last five years, it is Bangladesh. You can see how much we have bonded, and what benefits we are both getting out of closer structural linkages. Our Look-East Policy actually starts with Bangladesh, because if our relations with Bangladesh go as we hope it will go, you get a totally different access eastwards. So, the gains on that are enormous. The case I make with neighbours is, look, all our neighbours are smaller than us, I’m not counting China here in that category, and we need to be non-reciprocal, we need to be generous, they will have their own political cycles, there will be issues, after all, they will have their politics and a lot of the politics addresses us. We must accept that as a fact of life. But I would universally make the case again with that one westerly exception, so it’s not actually universal, that we need to have a very different view of our neighbours and actually that’s what we’ve been trying. Again, I’m not suggesting it would be automatic, smooth, not have its problems, it will, but we have to look beyond that. So, this has been sort of troubling me. So a part of it is a framework which is actually very apt to describe today’s world, which is why I used it so vividly. But it was also, for me, a part of what I would call cultural rebalancing. I would like the world to know and appreciate that this is their civilisation, this is their history, this is their epic. And, I think the world needs to know more about it as we rise. So I think that was part of it as well. Well, you know, I began by telling you that the book was inside me. The Mahabharata part of it was even deeper inside me. That is because I sort of grew up in a household where politics, history, were regular topics of discussion. And very early on, you know, we read the Mahabharata, we were encouraged to read the Mahabharata with a very implicit message. I mean, nobody actually said this explicitly as I’m saying it, which is if you are to think of all the issues in contemporary politics and security, etc, those situations, those concepts, those dilemmas, they are all there."

Parly will visit India on Thursday to attend a ceremony in Ambala to induct the first batch of five Rafale jets into the Indian Air Force (IAF). The French defence minister will hold talks with her Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. EXPLAINED | From speed to weapon capabilities of India’s Rafale fighter jets Afterwards, a traditional water cannon salute will be given to the Rafale aircraft, it said. A defence ministry spokesperson said Parly will be given a ceremonial Guard of Honour on her arrival in Delhi. The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore. The French defence minister will be accompanied by top executives from Dassault Aviation, Thales Group, Safran, and MBDA, representing the French defence majors that have been partnering with many Indian companies as part of the Rafale deal. France on Wednesday described India as its “foremost” Asian strategic partner and said the upcoming visit of its Defence Minister Florence Parly to the country is aimed at further strengthening the “forward-looking” defence cooperation with New Delhi. It will be Parly’s third visit to India since 2017 and one of her very first official trips since the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic, the embassy said. Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said, “This ceremony also marks the operational induction of this aircraft into the Indian Air Force.” The Rafale aircraft have been formally inducted into the Indian Air Force by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Rafale induction ceremony updates: The Indian Air Force (IAF) hosted a ceremony at the Ambala airbase to formally induct the first five Rafale fighter jets. Induction of these twin-engine modern fighters is being seen as a major boost to the IAF’s capabilities.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has said that India’s Rafale deal with France is a “game changer”. I am confident that induction of Rafales will revolutionise the Indian Air Force’s capabilities. With changing times, we need to stay prepared. National security remains a priority for this government. Today is a stellar achievement for both our countries. We are writing a new chapter in India-France defence ties. The name ‘Rafale’ symbolises “incredible strength”. It also symbolises our ties. Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria formally inducted Rafale fighters into Number 101 Squadron at Air Force Station Hasimara on Wednesday At the induction ceremony for the Rafale jets at Hasimara Air Force Station, Alipurduar, West Bengal. The Rafale Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), the Indian Air Force’s newest acquisition, was formally inducted into the 101 Squadron at Air Force Station (AFS) Hasimara in West Bengal’s Alipurduar district on July 28. The induction will significantly strengthen the Air Force’s capabilities on India’s eastern front. The induction ceremony at Hasimara AFS, presided over by the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal R.K.S. Bhadauria, was marked by a fly-past, heralding the arrival of the Rafale to Hasimara, and the traditional water cannon salute. Addressing IAF personnel during the induction ceremony, the Chief of the Air Staff said the decision to make Hasimara AFS the second main operating base (MOB) for the Rafale had come about after careful planning. It was a decision taken, he said, keeping in mind the importance of strengthening the IAF’s capability in the eastern sector. This induction marks the second of the IAF’s squadrons to be equipped with the Rafale aircraft. On September 10, 2020, five Rafale jets were formally inducted into the IAF’s 17 Squadron, the Golden Arrows, at a mega ceremony at AFS Ambala, which is located 200 kilometres north of Delhi and comes under the operational command of the Delhi headquartered Western Air Command. The 101 Squadron was formed on May 1, 1949, at Palam and has operated Harvard, Spitfire, Vampire, Su-7 and MiG-21M aircraft in the past. The glorious history of this squadron includes active participation in the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars. A squadron usually consists of 16 to 18 fighter aircraft and two trainers. The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, 2020, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 Rafales at a cost of Rs.59,000 crores. The delivery of all 36 Rafales, 30 of which will be single seater fighter aircraft, while six will be twin-seat trainers, is scheduled to be completed by 2022. As of July, Dassault have delivered 24 Rafales to India. Recalling the glorious history of the 101 Squadron, which was bestowed the title ‘Falcons of Chamb and Akhnoor'’, the Air Chief urged Air Force personnel to combine their zeal and commitment with the unmatched potential of the newly inducted platform. He added that he had no doubt that the 101 Squadron would dominate whenever and wherever required and ensure that the adversary would always be intimidated by their sheer presence. On September 10, 2020, the Indian Air Force is set to formally induct the Rafale Fighter Jets at the Ambala Airbase. At the time of formal induction, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will be present along with his French counterpart Florence Parly and Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria. 6- The jets are a part of the IAF's No. 17 Squadron 'Golden Arrows'. IAF inducts LCA Tejas: All you need to know about the 18 Squadron aircraft In March 2019, a replacement of MiG-21s by the Rafales were proposed by the government officials to counter Pakistan's newer F-16s. In late 2019, IAF accepted the aircraft at Dassault's Bordeaux manufacturing facility in an event attended by Defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart Florence Parly. The aircraft had ""RB-001"" to mark IAF chief-designate Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria's role in the 2016 deal. After a controversial procurement procedure, 5 Rafale fighter jets of the 36 ordered by IAF are on their way to India from Mérignac in France and will reach Ambala on July 29, 2020. The fighter jets took to skies on July 27, 2020, and have landed safely at Al Dhafra airbase, UAE. In the second half of August, the final induction ceremony is scheduled. The first batch of Rafales will join resurrected No 17 ‘Golden Arrows’ squadron of the Air Force. This squadron was created in the year 1951 and has witnessed many remarkable operations including the Kargil War amongst others. However, the squadron was disbanded in the year 2016 after the IAF started phasing out ageing Mig-21, operated by the Golden Arrows. In February 2011, Rafales flew demonstrations in India, including air-to-air combat against Su-30MKIs. On 27 April 2011, IAF shortlisted two fighter jets-- Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon for 10.4 billion USD. ON January 31, 2012, IAF announced Rafale as the preferred bidder due to its lower life-cycle cost. The Government of India kept a competition known as MMRCA (Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft) or the MRCA tender to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the IAF (Indian Air Force). In the year 2008, the Ministry of Defence, Government of India, allocated Rs. 55,000 crores to purchase the aircraft. The deal was India's single largest defence deal.  The contest featured the following aircraft:  Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon, Mikoyan MiG-35, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. In January 2016, the Government of India directed the Indian Navy to undertake detailed briefings with Dassault regarding the Rafale. On September 23, 2016, the then Defence Minister of India, Manohar Parrikar and the then Minister of Defence of France, Jean-Yves Le Drian signed a €7.8 billion contract for 36 off-the-shelf Rafales with an option for 18 more at the same inflation-adjusted price. In May 2013, as per a report by The Times of India, the negotiations were back on track with 18 Rafales to be delivered in India by 2017. Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria presided over the induction ceremony. Eastern Air Commander Air Marshal Amit Dev was also present.  “The event also included a fly-past heralding the arrival of Rafale aircraft to Hasimara followed by a traditional water cannon salute,” an Air Force statement said. The Indian Air Force Wednesday formally inducted the Rafale aircraft into the 101 Squadron of the Eastern Air Command—this is the second IAF squadron to be equipped with the new fighter jets. The 101 Squadron was formed on May 1, 1949 at Palam. It has operated the Harvard, Spitfire, Vampire, Su-7 and MiG-21M aircraft in the past, and participated in the 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan wars. The second squadron is being raised at Hasimara Air Force Station in West Bengal. The first squadron—17 Golden Arrows—was raised in Ambala, Punjab in September last year.

The Tejas LCA, Jaguar, Mig-29, Mig-21 and Sukhoi-30 aircraft were part of the rehearsal, besides the Rafale fighter jet, an IAF official said. The Indian Air Force came into force in 1932 as the Royal Indian Air Force under then British rule. The name was changed to Indian Air Force in 1950. Five Rafale fighter jets were formally inducted into the IAF on September 10, in a major boost to India's air power capability at a time when the country has been engaged in a months-long tense standoff with China in eastern Ladakh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended greetings to the ''brave warriors'' of the Indian Air Force (IAF). ""Many congratulations to all the brave warriors of the Indian Air Force on Air Force Day.

I wrote then what I felt at the time and I write now what I feel today…” writes the PM in the foreword of the book, that is slated to be released on September 17 on his 70th birthday. The entry is part of a series of monologues that the young worker had written over years to his “jagat janani (mother goddess)” to make sense of his ambitions and anxieties. First published in Gujarati in 2014, in a volume titled Saakshi Bhaav (Image Publishers), these letters have been translated into English by film critic and writer Bhawana Somaaya and published by HarperCollins India in a collection titled Letters to Mother. Somaaya says she began her transcreation of the book in early 2018 and finished it by the end of the year. “The reading took a long time and I had to read the passages again and again to fully comprehend the context. There were many challenges. Modi has excellent command over the Gujarati language and uses very unusual words, so it took a while to find appropriate expressions. The manuscript went through several drafts – there was a lot of rewriting until the content, emotion, rhythm was well synchronised,” she says. “I was attracted to the idea that the Prime Minister had written this book as a diary in the year 1986 when he was neither prime minister nor chief minister, and that it was written as letters to the mother goddess. The premise was interesting and I was surprised by his transparency of emotions, his intensity and the fact that he did not disguise his vulnerability. What drew me to his writing was his emotional quotient. He feels strongly and writes because he cannot contain himself. He may not be a professional writer but he has vivid imagination and is deeply connected to nature, rather to the universe,” says Somaaya. The 16 entries in the volume, which loosely resemble poems, are personal deliberations on a range of issues, including society’s increasing dependence on technology, the excitement of organising successful shibirs of pracharaks, meeting political figures such as Bal Thackeray for the first time at one such shibir, his expanding role in the party and the desolation the writer feels at a public meeting where he is unable to communicate his feelings to his audience. KT: Okay, now we’re coming to the end of this interview and I want you to at this moment relate three of the magnificent and glorious anecdotes that your book has. The first is to do with Prince Charles, as he then was. In 1980, he visited India. He was Prince of Wales at the time. You were his security liaison officer. Indira Gandhi, who was Prime Minister, invited him to lunch, but clearly the lunch didn’t go well, because you say when Prince Charles emerged from lunch, he looked as if he’d been caned. What happened? ASD: It is a change for the worse. Now, this is a complex sort of thing you know, stonewalling and backtracking. This has been a part of Delhi’s way of dealing with Kashmir. But the interesting thing here is, and people forget, that Sheikh Abdullah in his autobiography, The Blazing Chinar, devoted a whole chapter to the Kashmiri Pandits. And he says, “They are our stars in the firmament of Kashmir.” And people also forget that the Sheikh himself was a second or third-generation convert. And therefore, among the Jama’atis and those who are inclined towards Pakistan, who today say that Sheikh made a mistake in 1947, at that time also there were some Jama’atis who would say that Sheikh is a Kashmiri Pandit and so is Pandit Nehru. That is why they have joined together. ASD: Yeah, who wrote three books on the Nehru years. He says when he went to Madras after the Sheikh’s arrest and he met Rajaji – C. Rajagopalachari. Rajaji said to him, “Why did we need to slam the door on the Sheikh? Now you’ll never have peace in Kashmir.” ASD: I think they have good reason to feel betrayed. Yes, yes, yes. Let me take you back to where it actually all starts and this is part of the narrative that you’ll hear all the time in Kashmir. It goes back to Sheikh Abdullah’s arrest in August 1953, and, you know, there was a foreign secretary, the last one that Jawaharlal Nehru had, who continued as foreign secretary in Shastri’s time, YD Gundevia. In his memoir, I think it’s called Outside the Archives, Gundevia says, “Democracy died the day Sheikh was arrested. Democracy in Kashmir died the day Sheikh was arrested.” And another person B.N. Mullik in his book on Kashmir, you know, he wrote… KT: Okay. In the limited time left to us, I want to come to a third issue. You reveal in your book that in the late 1980s, Arjun Singh and V.C. Shukla, who were at the time leading Congressmen and everyone thought extremely loyal and supportive of Rajiv Gandhi, went and met Giani Zail Singh, who was President, to encourage him to form his own party. Giani didn’t take them seriously. He didn’t trust them. But the point you’re making is that V.C. Shukla and Arjun Singh were clearly plotting against Rajiv Gandhi. ASD: No, you’re right, you’re right. Let me put it like this. That if he was not ageing, like all of us are and he had time, I would imagine Doval as a future Home Minister of India. And you know the relationship between the NSA and the home minister in our structure has never been easy. I’ll give you an example. Let me take you back to 1996. Dr Farooq Abdullah was coming back as Chief Minister for the third time. Coincidentally it was a time when Ajit was being posted to Srinagar and Farooq had invited me for his swearing-in so I suggested to Ajit that he come along. I said this would be a good time to meet the Chief Minister. So he came and I took him straight from the airport to Farooq’s residence and I said this is one of our finest Intelligence Officers. So there were very cordial hellos and smiles and it was a great photo opportunity, except that there was no photographer. But what happened was that the chemistry didn’t work and Ajit gradually drifted away to the other side, to Mufti Sahab, and then the story is, one of the stories attributed to him, is that he played a role in creating the PDP. So these are the stories. Whether Ajit admits it or not, but this is talked about. KT: It’s suspected that Ajit Doval was responsible for the renewal of the 2003 Ceasefire, which happened in February of 2021. I’ll give you another example you know, about seven or eight years later. Peter Jones of the University of Ottawa, who used to do the back-channel track started a Spooks track on India-Pakistan and Ajit attended the first couple of sessions. Now when the first session took place, I remember very vividly, Peter Jones said to me, “Will you make a few introductory remarks?” I said okay. So I said Peter this is a serious dialogue, because you’ve got somebody in this room today who’s going to go places. So everybody looked around and then they realised that I was referring to Doval. And he left after I think two or three sessions because he knew what was happening, that elections were coming up. He was eyeing the NSA’s job and he left. But interestingly a couple of sessions later, the Pakistanis complained that nothing is happening, nothing’s moving. So again I made a suggestion I said, “I have a suggestion for you guys why don’t you invite Ajit Doval to Lahore?” He was then NSA. ASD: And when I talk about 1984, sorry to interrupt you, but when I talk about 1984, I think in some ways it also led to 1988, 1989. Everybody talks about the rigging in the 1987 elections, but I think it was Farooq’s dismissal which also began to encourage Pakistan that now was the right time to interfere in Kashmir. 25 March 11:00 gmt — India starts three-week lockdown How scientists are fighting the novel coronavirus: A three minute guide After autopsies, three people who died in Santa Clara County between 6 February and 6 March have been confirmed as having died of COVID-19, according to a statement released by the county’s department of public health on 21 April. The updated statistics include two people who died at home and a third whose location of death was not specified. Previously, the first COVID-19 death in the county was thought to have occurred on 9 March. 1 April 03:00 bst — Nearly 80% of US intensive-care patients have underlying conditions As of 17 March, there were 179,112 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, including 81,116 in China. Of the 7,426 deaths from the disease, 3,231 have been in China. Deaths from COVID-19 in Italy have exceeded those reported in China, after 473 people died in Italy in 24 hours. The coronavirus has so far killed 3,405 people there, according to official statistics from 19 March. In China, 3,242 people have died of the disease since the outbreak began in December, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The finding comes from the 31 March Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A study found that of about 7,000 people with COVID-19 for whom information about chronic conditions had been reported, just over one-third had an underlying condition. People with such conditions made up 71% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 and 78% of those who required intensive care. The first US COVID-19 death might have occurred in California on 6 February — three weeks before the first reported death, in Washington state. Since the outbreak began in December, there have been more than 80,000 reported cases in China, including over 3,300 deaths — the majority of which occurred in Wuhan, where the pandemic originated. The restrictions on movement into and out of Wuhan are lifting on 8 April. Conway had taught at Princeton University in New Jersey since 1987, and his research spanned several fields of mathematics. In algebra, he studied the ‘monster group’, an object that has an enormous — but not infinite — number of symmetries. With the late British mathematician Simon Norton, he formulated the ‘monstrous moonshine’ conjectures, linking the monster group to an entirely different subject in mathematical analysis. As a post-independence civil servant, Dr Khan had one of the cleanest images among his CSP contemporaries, and ultimately went on to become one of the longest serving finance secretaries  as well as cabinet secretary under three successive regimes. After retirement, he served as an alternate executive director in the World Bank headquarters till 2005, followed by his brief stint in the caretaker government of 2006-07 that lasted until his resignation over disagreements with the then president in January 2007. This was followed by his appointment as the chairman of the Regulatory Reforms Commission (RRC) in October 2007 by the caretaker government led by Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed, when he introduced many reform measures in the delivery of public sector services, including introduction of citizen's charter at all government offices. But he resigned from that position in October 2009 citing non-cooperation from the newly elected government. After that, he has been serving as an adjunct professor at several private universities of the country including BRAC University. Eminent economist cum historian, retired secretary, renowned academic and former adviser to the caretaker government Dr Akbar Ali Khan passed away all of a sudden on September 8, 2022, -- leaving behind a legacy that is bound to last for many years in the intellectual domain of Bangladesh. Dr Helal Uddin Ahmed is a retired Additional Secretary and former Editor of Bangladesh Quarterly. The scholarly journey that Dr Akbar Ali Khan had started with the publication of his book 'Discovery of Bangladesh' in 1996 did not stop there. As pointed out by a former economist of the World Bank Group Syed Akhtar Mahmood (my senior at both Islamabad Model School and Dhaka Residential Model School) in a recent article, ""Indeed, for much of his life, the works of Akbar Ali Khan, the voracious reader, dedicated scholar, relentless writer and courageous public intellectual, has been a journey of discovery. With a generosity of spirit, the boldness of a principled man, and the power of his pen, Akbar Ali Khan has shared with us the fruits of that journey. By doing so, he has encouraged us to embark on our own explorations into the dynamics of a hidden nation"". A VORACIOUS READER TO A PROLIFIC WRITER: Regarding his transition from being a voracious reader to that of a prolific writer, Dr Khan wrote in his autobiography, ""I am basically a bookworm. I did not consciously seek to become a writer; rather I wanted to remain a reader. Much pain has to be endured for becoming a writer. I therefore studied many subjects, but did not write any book. When I started writing books, my age had crossed 50"". On looking back at his life and career, what strikes me most was his spirit of perseverance in the face of chronic adversities. In spite of the passing away of his wife Hameem Khan and the only daughter Nehreen Khan in 2016, he did not put any brake to his intellectual or academic pursuits despite his ill-health. His autobiographical book 'Purano Shei Diner Katha' (Accounts of Old Days) was published only this year, and he was already working on the second volume of the book when death suddenly struck. His centenarian mother-in-law Jahanara Rahman (a first-batch student of Lady Brabourne College, Kolkata) was the lone companion during his last days in Gulshan, Dhaka. Dr Khan held her in great esteem, as she helped him in partially overcoming the inconsolable grief and sorrow of losing his closest kin and also took care of him despite her advanced age. Born in 1944 at Nabinagar of Brahmanbaria, he was a bookworm since his school-days, and subsequently proved his academic mettle when he topped the list in both bachelor's and master's degree examinations at the history department of Dhaka University. He then joined the Civil Service of Pakistan (CSP) in 1967, but defected from the Pakistani government to join the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 while serving as a sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Habiganj. After independence, he started teaching history as an Assistant Professor at Jahangirnagar University, on lien from the government in 1973, and subsequently did his Phd in economics from Canada's Queen's University in 1979 as a Commonwealth Scholar. Although he was then promoted as Associate Professor at Jahangirnagar University, he switched sides once again and returned to his erstwhile civil service profession during the 1980s. Similarly, Pervez Musharraf, the former president of Pakistan, advocated in July 2003 for a national discussion on the viability of establishing diplomatic ties with Israel, speculating that such a discussion might serve as a counterbalance to Pakistan’s antagonistic relationship with India. However, it should be noted that any attempt by Pakistan to normalize relations with Israel would inevitably require overcoming a number of formidable challenges, such as divisions within the military, opposition from political rivals, and hostile rhetoric from Islamic clerics.

Despite the state being battered by back-to-back, debilitating calamities, these headlines offer a snapshot of the large-scale, land-altering changes being made across Kerala’s densely-populated landscape, especially in the fragile Western Ghats. Quarries and stone-crushing units continue to operate in ecologically sensitive areas. Highways are being unscientifically carved out of hills. “But the unfortunate aspect is that our local bodies remain in the hangover of mainstream political parties. In a panchayati raj system, the gram sabha is supposed to be the most powerful body. But in Kerala, it’s not like that. Our local bodies are not decentralised or democratic in any way. That’s why political parties detest Gadgil. They are not in favour of political power going down to the grassroots,” claims Neelakandan. “Kerala to oppose quarry distance norms, greens blame it on lobby.” In fact, the Economic Review 2019 of the state planning board following the 2018 floods is unambiguous in its findings. “Forest fragmentation was a major contributing factor to the landslides. In that context, ecologists have repeatedly cited the 2011 Gadgil panel report as the ideal blueprint to address the concerns in the Ghats so as to prevent future calamities. But even a passing mention of the report in parts like Idukki inflames passions among the locals who consider it ‘impractical’ and purportedly invented to displace them and rob their livelihoods. In the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Idukki, the report and its ramifications became a rallying cry for vested religious groups and corporate lobbies to garner vote-banks. “Pettimudi had a high altitude, so automatically it was disaster-prone. It’s also one of the wettest areas in the state. Even small changes can amplify and cause big impact (in the Ghats),” he says, over a phone call. And so, in the absence of any incremental progress on land reforms even in a state ruled by the Left, it shouldn’t come off as a surprise that the poorest and marginalised sections bear the brunt of ecological and climate change-related disasters, say ecologists. For Kumar, the landslide has not just claimed a close friend. It has also subconsciously rewritten the concepts of safety and security of a region where people like him were born and raised in. Like Bharathi, he and his family also live in ‘layams’ a few kilometres away, surrounded by the all-too-familiar green cascade of the tea estates and the looming hills of the Ghats. Biju Sebastian, a geologist with the state government who submitted a preliminary report on the landslide to the district collector, says it originated in a shola forest area atop a hill. “Due to excess rainfall, the soil in the shola forest became loose and came down the steep slope of the hill, accumulating boulders and sludge along with it. The path of the debris flow, almost 1.2 kilometres long, has a few bends. There was an existing streamlet along the slope which converged with the debris flow and finally washed down at the bottom over the ‘layams’,” he says. Also read | Pettimudi underlines why Kerala is the Petri dish for climate change and reckless development He is one among those who settled in the Nilgiris after the Sirima-Shastri pact was enacted. “People have blamed us for climate change, landslides and floods that have taken place in Nilgiris. I don’t understand direct or indirect connection between us and climate change. The Tamil Nadu government allocated living spaces for us in the most vulnerable areas,” he said. HN Shivan, founder-president of the Nilgiris Nelikolu Micro and Small Tea Growers and Farmers Devt Society in Ooty, believes the underlying reasons of natural disasters like landslides go back to the large-scale changes of land use. Meanwhile, workers in the Willony upper-division tea estate in Valparai said the tragedy at Pettimudi in Kerala persuaded the Tata Tea company to provide new living quarters. The quarters in which they lived earlier was next to a hill. “But now, everything has changed. People are encouraged to grow tea, cash crops and imported tree species. Imported tree species cannot withstand the Nilgiris’ weather conditions and get uprooted even in a slight downpour.” “Do you know what layam is? It refers to kudhirai layam (horse shed). When thousands of people from southern Tamil Nadu districts were brought into the Ghats of India and tea-growing regions like Kandy in Sri Lanka as plantation workers, there were no proper shelters. Most of them lived in horse-sheds which were abandoned by British officials. That’s why they call their residential areas ‘layams or line houses,” said MS Selvaraj, Convener of Vivasayigal Thozhilalargal Munnetra Sangham (VTMS), an outfit that works among plantation workers and tribes. Assistant Professor Manivannan at the Ooty Arts and Science College said the use of the weed-whacking herbicide called ‘roundup’ for many years has caused huge damage to the soil in the Western Ghats. As a result, the soil has become too loose, unable to absorb water. Several new dams on rivers flowing through the region has also caused changes in the direction and water current of the river, he said. Vijayan, an advocate in the Nilgiris, attested that successive governments have failed to address the concerns of the workers in the ‘layams’ even as it allowed outsiders to come in and build properties by snatching land from the indeginous people. Ramakrishnan alleged that the government’s agriculture department is not promoting the importance of planting native trees. Besides, heavy monsoons have been seen as adversely impacting the fortunes of tea growers."

This is necessary as toys can be used to build minds. Even Rabindra Nath Tagore has spoken about the importance of toys,” he said. In a fresh push for Atma Nirbhar Bharat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the country has the ability to become a toy hub for the entire world and called upon young entrepreneurs to ‘team up for toys’ as part of his government’s ‘vocal for local’ initiative. It is important that our youngsters are aware of them, he said in his radio programme. Modi also lauded the various mobile apps that were part of the “app innovation challenge” and urged young entrepreneurs to develop computer games in the country."

More interestingly, it is only during 16 seasons that these dams overflowed simultaneously, data available with Rajkot and Bhavnagar irrigation circles showed. The dams overflowed simultaneously for the first time in 1965. The occurrence repeated itself only five years later in 1970. But after that, it was only after seven years — in 1977 — that the two dams overflowed together. Following good rainfall in their catchment areas, Sehtrunji dam overflowed on August 19 and Bhadar dam followed on August 21. It was for the first time since 2015, and the 16th time overall, that the two dams overflowed simultaneously during the same season. FOLLOWING HEAVY rains, the irrigation department discharged water in large volumes from Shetrunji and Bhadar dams, the two largest reservoirs in the water-starved Saurashtra region, on Sunday. The current monsoon marks only the 16th season in the 55-year-long history of the twin dams, and the first time in the past five years, when they have overflowed simultaneously. The longest streak of them overflowing together, for three consecutive seasons, was recorded only in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The two consecutive seasons have been recorded only once when the dams had overflowed together in 1979 and 1980. Overall, the dams overflowed simultaneously in 1965, 1970, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1983, 1988, 1994, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2020. The longest period between two seasons when the dam did not overflow was recorded between 1994 and 2002 in case of Shetrunji and 1970 and 1977 in case of Bhadar. Saurashtra region has received more than 100 percent of its average rainfall this year. But in the peninsular region, almost every fourth monsoon remains a deficient monsoon. Even within 11 districts of Saurashtra, spatial distribution of rainfall remains skewed, as evidenced by 12 different years in which either only Bhadar or Shetrunji dam overflowed, officers said. Located at Lilakha village in Gondal taluka Rajkot, Bhadar dam has a gross storage capacity of 188.14 million cubic metres (mcm), the second-highest in the Saurashtra region after the Shetrunji dam. “Construction work for this dam started in 1952 and water for irrigation from it was given to farmers for the first time in 1963. The gates were quite old and needed to be replaced. Officials from the Dam Safety Organisation (DSO) had also visited the dam some time ago and it was felt that the gates needed to be replaced,” a source in the irrigation department said. Engineers of Rajkot Irrigation Projects Circle of the irrigation department said the work on replacing all the floodgates of the dam started in January and is expected to be completed by the end of the next month. After the 2015 flash floods damaged three floodgates of the Bhadar dam, the second largest reservoir of Saurashtra, the state irrigation department began replacing all its 29 floodgates and is likely to complete the work by April end. “As per the latest status, 14 floodgates have already been replaced. Our target is to complete the work by end-March,” Shailesh Patel, the executive engineer of (RIPC), said. “An inspection by the Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI), Vadodara, recently had recommended that the gates should be replaced. Dam Safety Organisation of Central Water Commission had also made similar recommendations,” Patel said. The executive engineer added the gates of the dams are being replaced after around 65 years."

Sad to hear that former President Pranab Mukherjee is no more, his demise is passing of an era.” “With a heavy heart, this is to inform you that my father Shri Pranab Mukherjee has just passed away in spite of the best efforts of Doctors of RR Hospital and prayers duas and prarthanas from people throughout India! I thank all of You Folded hands,” his son Abhijit Mukherjee tweeted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Mukherjee left an indelible mark on India’s development trajectory. “India grieves the passing away of Bharat Ratna Shri Pranab Mukherjee. A scholar par excellence, a towering statesman, he was admired across the political spectrum and by all sections of society,” PM Modi tweeted. READ | Pranab Mukherjee, the Prime Minister that Congress never gave to India Pranab Mukherjee’s political journey started in West Bengal in the 1969 by-election in Midnapore when he was the election agent for V K Krishna Menon, who ran as an independent candidate. He caught the eye of Siddhartha Shankar Ray who recommended him to Indira Gandhi, who gave him a Rajya Sabha seat. Thus at the age of 35, Mukherjee entered the Rajya Sabha. Besides serving two terms as finance minister, Mukherjee also held the post of commerce minister in 1993 and is known for championing the cause of trade liberalisation. Former president Pranab Mukherjee (84) passed away on Monday after his condition declined earlier in the day and he suffered a septic shock due to his lung infection, the Army’s Research and Referral Hospital said. For the past two weeks, Mukherjee was in a deep coma and on ventilator support after he was was admitted to the hospital on August 10 and was operated the same day for removal of a clot in his brain. Mukherjee was the 13th President of India from 2012 to 2017. The government has announced a seven-day state mourning. In a statement, the Home Ministry said that as a mark of respect, state mourning would be observed for seven days throughout India from August 31 to September 6. “During the period of state mourning, the national flag will fly at half-mast on all buildings throughout India, where it is flown regularly, and there will be no official entertainment,” the statement said. Interestingly, Mukherjee, nicknamed ‘Poltu da’, had come close to becoming the prime minister in 2012. In his own words, he got a sense that he could replace Manmohan Singh, who could be sent to Rashtrapati Bhawan. But destiny had other plans. With great sadness, the nation receives the news of the unfortunate demise of our former President Shri Pranab Mukherjee. India grieves the passing away of Bharat Ratna Shri Pranab Mukherjee.

However, after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984, he was sidelined from the Congress under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi (son of Indira Gandhi). He was expelled from the mainstream politics and was sent to the regional West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee. Pranab Mukherjee retired from active politics and ended his affiliation with the Indian National Congress as he was running for President in 2012. On July 25, 2012, he became the President of India. In 2017, he did not run for re-elections and retired from politics citing age-related health complications. His term expired on July 25, 2017, and was succeeded as the President of India by Ram Nath Kovind. In 1991, after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, PV Narasimha Rao appointed Muukherje as the Deputy Chairman of the Indian planning commission. From 1995-1996, Mukherjee served as the External Affairs Minister in Narasimha Rao's cabinet. Following his expulsion from the mainstream politics, Mukherjee formed Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress (RSC) in West Bengal which later merged with the Congress after a compromise with Rajiv Gandhi. His elder son Abhijit is a Congress MP from Jangipur, West Bengal and his daughter Sharmishtha is a Kathak dancer and a politician with Congress. On July 13, 1957, Pranab Mukherjee married Surva Mukherjee and the couple had two sons (Indrajit Mukherjee and Abhijit Mukherjee and a daughter (Sharmistha Mukherjee). His wife Surva migrated from Narail, Bangladesh to Kolkata when she was 10. She died on August 18, 2015, due to a cardiac arrest, at the age of 74. Prior to politics, he served as an upper-division Clerk in the Office of Deputy Accountant-General, Calcutta. In the year 1963, he joined Vidyanagar College, Kolkata as an Assistant Professor of Political Science. He also worked for Desher Dak (Call of Motherland) as a journalist. It is believed that due to Pranab Mukherjee, the entry of Sonia Gandhi in politics was successful. In 1998-1999, after Sonia Gandhi became the President of Congress, Mukherjee was appointed as the General Secretary of the AICC. From 2000 until his resignation in 2010, Pranab Mukherjee served as the President of the West Bengal Congress. Pranab Mukherjee did his schooling from Suri Vidyasagar College, Suri. He did his Masters in Political Science and History from the University of Calcutta. From the same university, he earned his LLB degree.

Their grand aim is to ensure that India does not build infrastructure along the LAC, change the status of Ladakh, cosy up to the US and join the anti-China chorus caused by Covid-19. It is their way of attaining a political goal with military might, while gaining more territory in the process.’’ General VK Singh (retd) expressed his condolences after an officer and two soldiers lost their lives in a violent face off in the Galwan Valley.

Speaking over the new farm laws in the Lok Sabha, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said these laws are not religious scripture to which changes cannot be made. 'If they (farmers) want it to be repealed, why can't you talk to them? I request that let's not stand on prestige. It's our nation. We belong to this nation, let's respect everybody in the nation,' he said.

Before becoming the President of India in 2012, he had at different points of time been the chief whip of the Congress Parliamentary Party, and an important minister in various Cabinets. Chavan writes: “In Dr Manmohan Singh’s cabinet, Pranabda was the de facto number two. He was the chairman of more than 95 GoMs and EGoMs (Empowered Group of Ministers)… Pranabda worked under three Prime Ministers – Indiraji, Narasimha Rao and Dr Manmohan Singh. He is the only finance minister to have presented budgets both before the 1991 reforms in the license-permit raj regime as well after the 1991 economic reforms. He took bold decisions after the global economic crisis of 2008 which helped shield the Indian economy.” Mukherjee was first noticed by Siddhartha Shankar Ray, former Bengal CM, when he was serving as V K Krishna Menon’s election agent in the 1969 Midnapore by-election. Ray recommended him to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who later gave the 35-year-old Mukherjee a Rajya Sabha seat. Soon, he was known to have Indira’s ear and became a minister of state in her government. In 1997, when Sonia Gandhi finally became a member and a year later president of the Congress party, Mukherjee played a big role in mentoring her. Mukherjee’s tenure as President of India continued after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014. In 2018, after he had vacated Rashtrapati Bhavan, Mukherjee attended an RSS event as chief guest, a move criticized by many in his party, including his daughter and Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee. Mukherjee almost became the Prime Minister of India twice – after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984, and after Sonia Gandhi refused the top post in 2004. While that did not happen, Mukherjee continued to serve the Congress party and government in other roles. Former President Pranab Mukherjee passed away on Monday. Mukherjee, 84, had undergone a brain surgery at the Army Research and Referral hospital earlier this month, and was on ventilator support. He had also contracted Covid-19. For a brief period, he did quit the Congress to start his own party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress (RSC), in West Bengal in 1986. However, three years later, the party merged with the Congress after Rajiv Gandhi and Mukherjee arrived at a compromise. After Rajiv was assassinated, Narasimha Rao became Prime Minister, and Mukherjee was appointed the deputy chairman of the Indian planning commission and subsequently, in 1995, the External Affairs minister. Mukherjee stood steadfast with Indira throughout the Emergency and the splitting of the Congress. His rough patch in the Congress started after Indira’s assassination, when he was sidelined in the PM race and Indira’s son Rajiv Gandhi took over. In the parliamentary elections held in December 1984, Congress won a massive mandate. Mukherjee found no place in Rajiv Gandhi’s cabinet. This was when he left the Congress, but later came back.

They were four persons led by a senior surveyor while three others were assisting him,” said Jatinder Singh, vice president of Ceigall India Limited, which executed the construction work of the corridor in India. From the Indian side, officials of the National Highway Authority of India participated in the meeting. India has already constructed its 100-metre long portion of the bridge as part of the Kartarpur Corridor project. Pakistan is yet to build the bridge on its side. Pakistan engineers had to conduct survey on the Indian part of the overbridge so that they can construct the remaining part on their side. India has a flood control dam (dhusi band) to stop the overflowing Ravi water from entering into Dera Baba Nanak town. This dhusi band is around 100 metres from zero line. Singh said that Pakistan has to build 260-metre portion of the bridge over the low-lying area in its territory. “They will take this data and get part of the bridge designed and thereafter, the work will start,” he added. “Pakistan officials were keen on building the bridge. Initially, they were not ready for constructing the bridge. But now it seems not a big issue. They would need measurement of the bridge constructed by us so that their bridge can meet ours. These measurements should have been decided before first brick was laid for construction of corridor. But in case of Kartarpur Corridor, construction came first and negotiations later,” said an official of the National Highway Authority of India.

""I can't understand the logic to have a separate fund. Opposing the The Taxation and other Laws (Relaxation & Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020, TMC MP Mahua Moitra in Lok Sabha said that the bill is deeply problematic because it further weakens the rights & resources available to states by taking away statutory promises made under the new GST regime. 'These Bills are nothing but a sugar coated pill. This should be opposed at all costs,' the CM said.

Officials from the two sides, during the 24th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs held virtually, reviewed the LAC situation and agreed to “continue the discussions through diplomatic and military channels to resolve the remaining issues along the LAC at the earliest so as to create conditions for restoration of normalcy in bilateral relations,” the Ministry of External Affairs said. The two sides discussed the LAC during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s March 25 visit to New Delhi. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said then he would describe the “current situation as work in progress, obviously at a slower pace than desirable”. He said the two foreign ministers discussed “expediting” it, and underlined India’s stand that “restoration of normalcy [in relations] will obviously require a restoration of peace and tranquillity.” The Chinese Foreign Ministry in a statement on Tuesday said both had agreed to “resolve the remaining issues in the Western Section of the border in accordance with the principle of mutual and equal security.” Asked about the impact of the border issue on trade and investment, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China “always believes that the boundary question doesn’t represent the whole of China-India relations and we should put it in an appropriate position in bilateral relations and under effective control and management.” May 31, 2022 07:20 pm | Updated June 01, 2022 07:51 am IST - Hong Kong The Indian and Chinese sides reviewed the situation in eastern Ladakh at a meeting held under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs. File| Photo Credit: PTI Both sides failed to achieve a breakthrough in the 15th round of talks held on March 11, when they discussed disengagement at Patrolling Point 15 in the Hot Springs area. Officials previously suggested they expected resolution at PP15 at an early date, but differences in Demchok and Depsang, the two other remaining areas, were more pronounced. Following 14 rounds of talks, troops have disengaged at other friction areas including Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake. “In this context, they agreed to hold the next (16th) round of the Senior Commanders meeting at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols,” the MEA added. New Delhi: India and China will hold another round of high-level military talks on Sunday with a focus on making some forward movement in the disengagement process in the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh, government sources said. The talks are scheduled to start at 10:30 AM at the Moldo border point on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, the sources said on Saturday. The Indian delegation at Sunday’s talks is to be led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps. Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in a brief face-off near Yangtse in the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh last week and it was resolved within few hours following talks between commanders of the two sides as per established protocols, people familiar with the development said on Friday. He also said if the Chinese military maintains the deployment through the second winter, then it may lead to an LoC-like situation (Line of Control) though not an active LoC as is there on the western front with Pakistan. The 12th round of talks had taken place on July 31. Days after the talks, the two armies completed the disengagement process in Gogra, which was seen as a significant forward movement towards the restoration of peace and tranquillity in the region. The transgression took place on August 30, and the Chinese troops returned from the area after spending few hours. The 13th round of talks is taking place in the backdrop of two recent incidents of attempted transgressions by the Chinese troops — one in the Barahoti sector of Uttarakhand and another in the Tawang sector in Arunachal Pradesh. As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area in August. Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravne on Saturday said the military build-up by China in the eastern Ladakh region and new infrastructure development to sustain the large-scale deployment are a matter of concern. New Delhi: India and China are likely to hold the next round of corps commander level talks on Friday and they are expected to focus on disengagement of troops in remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the development said. The people said the two sides had an exchange of views on holding the 11th round of military talks on Friday. In the subsequent military talks on February 20, India insisted on the resolution of outstanding issues including in Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra. They said the armies of the two countries are now expected to hold the next round of Corps commander-level talks next week to thrash out modalities to take forward the disengagement process from the Finger points at Pangong Tso. The Indian Army is making elaborate preparations for the long haul in eastern Ladakh even as it awaits confirmation from the Chinese military for the fifth round of military talks which was earlier expected to take place this week, they said. On July 24, the two sides held another round of diplomatic talks on the border issue. Three weeks after the Galwan Valley clashes, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a nearly two-hour-long telephonic conversation on July 5 to bring down tension in the region. Both sides commenced the disengagement process from July 6 following the Doval-Wang talks who are Special Representatives for the boundary question. They said the top military and strategic brass reviewed the overall situation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere on Saturday, adding Army chief Gen MM Naravane has been regularly updating Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on matters relating to operational preparedness. The sources said India conveyed a firm message to the Chinese side that it has to implement the disengagement process as agreed to during the four rounds of Corps commander-level talks between the two armies. After the fourth round of Corps commander-level talks, the Army said both sides are committed to ""complete disengagement"" of troops, adding the process is ""intricate"" and that it requires ""constant verification"".

India and China will hold the 16th round of high-level military talks on 17 July to resolve the lingering border standoff in eastern Ladakh. ""In continuation with the talks on disengagement along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, the 16th round of talks will be held on the Indian side at Chushul-Moldo meeting point on 17 July,"" news agency PTI reported, quoting a source. The situation in eastern Ladakh figured prominently in their one-hour-long interaction on the sidelines of a conclave of foreign ministers of the G20 nations. In May, India and China held diplomatic talks on the border row and agreed to hold the next round of the Senior Commanders' meeting at an early date to achieve complete disengagement from all friction points in eastern Ladakh. What can be expected out of the talks on Sunday? The last round of talks between the Indian Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) took place on 11 March.

New Delhi: India and China on Friday, March 11, held another round of high-level military dialogue to resolve the 22-month-long standoff in certain remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh, two months after the last round of such talks failed to yield any significant outcome in resolving the row. The 15th round of Corps-Commander level talks began at Chushul-Moldo border point to resolve the 22-month-long standoff. The Chinese delegation at the talks was to be headed by Maj Gen Yang Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang Military District.

At the one-hour meeting in Bali on the sidelines of a conclave of foreign ministers of the G20 nations, Jaishankar conveyed to Wang the need for early resolution of all the outstanding issues in eastern Ladakh. The situation in eastern Ladakh figured prominently in last week's talks between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Bali.

NEW DELHI: India and China held the 17th round of Corps Commander-level talks on 20 December at Chushul-Moldo border meeting point on the Chinese side, with a focus on resolving issues in eastern Ladakh, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Thursday. The meeting came five months after the countries met for the 16th round of talks in July. “Building on the progress made after the last meeting on 17th July 2022, the two sides exchanged views on the resolution of the relevant issues along the LAC in the Western Sector (eastern Ladakh) in an open and constructive manner,"" the defence ministry said in the statement. The talks come days after Chinese and Indian troops engaged in a fresh clash in the Yangtse area of Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang sector on 9 December. This is a subscriber only feature Subscribe Now to get daily updates on WhatsApp After the meeting, it appeared that India would now look ahead to 2023, when it will host two major international gatherings that include China: the G-20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, has been on a whirlwind diplomatic tour in recent weeks, with high-profile meetings in Europe, Myanmar, Pakistan — where he also met with Taliban officials — and back home in Beijing with the U.S. ambassador to China. With U.S.-China relations as frosty as ever, Qin’s meeting with Ambassador Nicholas Burns signals that both sides want to manage better manage their differences. In Europe, Beijing is promoting its peace plan for Ukraine despite European concerns that Beijing is decidedly pro-Moscow. Meanwhile, amid crises in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Myanmar, China is wielding its clout to advance its own interests in spite of the implications for long-term stability. Since China’s post-COVID opening in January of this year, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his army of diplomats have begun intensifying their campaign for China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI). Xi first proposed the GSI last April, offering few details but saying the initiative would “promote security for all in the world.” Beijing has since elaborated in more detail through a Ministry of Foreign Affairs concept paper and has connected the GSI to its peace plan for Ukraine and the rapprochement it brokered between old rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. Above all, the initiative aims to promote a vision of an alternative to the U.S.-led international order. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. is in Washington this week, capping off a period in which Washington-Manila ties have seen a sharp turnaround. During former President Rodrigo Duterte’s six-year tenure, he sought to align Manila closer with Beijing, but with ultimately little to show for it. Since taking office last June, Marcos has moved to reverse course, dramatically deepening the 70-year-old U.S.-Philippines security alliance amid China’s increasingly coercive actions in the South China Sea. It is expected that Marcos and President Joe Biden will announce this week plans for stepped up military coordination. Markey: In many ways, this skirmish comes as a surprise at this point in time. On the sidelines of the Bali G-20 meetings in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally spoke, albeit briefly, for the first time since 2020. After this latest incident, Chinese and Indian military commanders met again to defuse any risk of further escalation. In a parliamentary briefing, Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh claimed the incident began when Chinese troops crossed the LAC in the Tawang sector to “unilaterally change the status quo.” Chinese sources disputed that characterization of events, but claimed the situation on the border was “under control.” As an added step, U.S. leaders can privately rally support for India among U.S. allies and partners, just as they have done for Ukraine over the past year. Public admonitions of territorial incursions and support for de-escalation from European and East Asian capitals might help to shape some of China’s decision-making. For its part, Beijing has repeatedly pressed New Delhi to move past the 2020 skirmish, normalize the relationship and focus on areas of mutual interest — including booming bilateral trade and regional governance. Given this context, Modi and Xi would appear to have ample reasons to shelve their border dispute, at least temporarily, and attend to other pressing matters. Tuesday, December 20, 2022        /By: Sameer P. Lalwani, Ph.D.;  Daniel Markey, Ph.D.;  Vikram J. Singh First, the two sides have a series of agreements going back to 1993 to manage their disputed border. In 2005, the two sides agreed on a protocol for implementing their border management commitments, reiterating that “the two sides will resolve the boundary question through peaceful and friendly consultations, including a bilateral commitment to resolve border issues by peaceful means.”"

The peace process must be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe. And a political solution should mean an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan”. Lavrov added that Russia would welcome consultations on how to “reinforce” a domestic peace agreement with confidence buildings measures involving Afghanistan’s neighbours. “We always say that neighbours and all powerful actors in the region should set up conditions for the Afghan population to agree domestically”. On a question about Russia’s position on the inclusion of Taliban in the Afghan peace process, Lavrov stated that the Taliban is a “part of Afghan society and decisions on the settlement in Afghanistan should foresee the participation of all political, ethnic and religious groups in Afghanistan, otherwise, it won’t be stable”. With Lavrov putting Pakistan on his travel schedule, the situation in Afghanistan was never far from the discussion table. Lavrov was in Delhi for a brief working visit during which he held talks with Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar. After a joint press conference, the Russian delegation left for Islamabad in the afternoon. Also read: Russian Foreign Minister, US Climate Envoy Hold Tête-à-Tête in Delhi Hotel Lobby New Delhi: Asserting that he did not see any “changes” in “Indian partners” due to pressure from the United States, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on April 6 that he held discussions with his counterpart in New Delhi on manufacturing Russian defence equipment on Indian soil. Jaishankar said that India shared the view-point that contemporary challenges require countries to work together in new and different ways, when it came to the Indo-Pacific. “Such cooperation also reflects the multi-polar and rebalanced character of global politics. India is strongly committed to ASEAN centrality and this is underlined by the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative that it has been advocating at the East-Asia summit. As we implement our Act East and Beyond policy, Russia is a very important partner. Whether it is their Far East or whether it is the Chennai-Vladivostok Corridor”. “By the way, I have heard speculation of military alliance not only in regarding with Russian-Chinese relations but also alliances being promoted such as ‘middle east NATO’. We also heard about ‘Asian NATO’,” he said. With the COVID-19 pandemic surging through India in a second wave, the Indian minister noted, “We have a Russian vaccine under discussion for production in India”. He said the decision had to be taken by regulatory authorities. 🇵🇰 🇷🇺 share convergent positions on several issues on multilateral agenda including peace & stability in Afghanistan.

The FM also commended Russian efforts for peace in Afghanistan. During the joint press conference, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stated that political dialogue has been created at the highest of levels. The agreement was signed at the PM House during the visit of Deputy Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia “Pakistan desires peace in the region and resolution of all outstanding disputes including Jammu and Kashmir through peaceful means,” Qureshi said. ""We believe that we should not forget the task of establishing the state of Palestine,"" Lavrov observed, adding that Russia stood ready to facilitate a direct dialogue between Palestine and Israel. #Live: Pakistan, Russian FMs addressing a joint press conference in Islamabad. @ForeignOfficePk @RusEmbPakistan @mfa_russia #RussianFMinPakistan https://t.co/1A5yTdbppH During our talks we considered ideas to further promote #EconomicDiplomacy and discussed progress in the area of energy cooperation including the Pakistan-Stream Gas Pipeline project.

The Russian FM further informed that the two countries agreed on presenting coordinated views in international organisations such as the United Nations to best serve their interests. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are also expected to attend these meetings. India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. Announcing Jaishankar’s visit, the external affairs ministry said the foreign ministers’ conference will also assess the preparation for the upcoming meeting of SCO  Council of Heads of States on September 16-17 in Dushanbe, and exchange views on current international and regional issues. During the visit, the external affairs minister will also attend the meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan on July 14. This meeting will also see the participation of the Afghanistan government, the MEA said. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will visit Tajikistan on July 13-14 to attend the SCO Council meeting of Foreign Ministers and the Contact Group on Afghanistan which will review the worsening security situation in that country amidst speedy return of American forces to the US. While Jaishankar is expected to hold bilateral talks with foreign ministers of some participating countries on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meet, there was no official word on any bilateral interaction or pull aside with Pakistan or China. Jaishankar’s visit to Tajikistan comes at the invitation of Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin, MEA said, adding that the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting will discuss the achievements of the organisation as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of its formation this year. Foreign Policy has learned from a senior Afghan diplomat that the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping mission was first brought up a few months ago by Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan American diplomat and the architect of America’s agreement in Doha, Qatar, with the Taliban. Reports suggest that China might consider sending a contingent of peacekeepers to Afghanistan. Its ally Pakistan, the Taliban’s patron, however, has no need of it. Indians are skeptical of the idea. India is too cautious a military player to deploy its army in Afghanistan, but some Afghans contend that India could send its peacekeepers under the flag of the United Nations. Davood Moradian, an Afghan analyst, wrote that the U.N. must play a leading role, including in filling the emerging security vacuum by deploying its peacekeeping mission for Afghanistan. “A UN peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan can bring together Pakistan and India in preventing the country’s slide toward anarchy and State breakdown,” he wrote. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova on convincing the rest of the world to stand on the right side of history. Suhail Shaheen, a spokesperson for the group, spoke to Foreign Policy from Doha soon after he returned from Moscow, where he and his colleagues assuaged Russia’s concerns on sliding security in areas bordering former Soviet states. Shaheen demanded that India must first prove its neutrality in the conflict if it wants to talk to the Taliban. “We have political relations with Russia, Iran, and China not for one or two but many years. We have visited them many times and assured them that we won’t let Afghan territory be used against them,” he said. “India was siding with the government installed by foreigners. They are not with us. If they stick to their policy of supporting a government imposed on Afghans, then maybe they should be worried. That is a wrong policy which will not serve them.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to generate a wide spectrum of reactions around the world. While Western policymakers have mobilized to help Kyiv and punish Moscow, large parts of t...Show morehe global south have either sat on the fence or provided Russian President Vladimir Putin with diplomatic or economic support. Kyiv wants to shift this dynamic in its favor: It wants to explain to developing economies why they should care more about the war in Ukraine. And one person it’s deploying to convey this message is Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova, who has been visiting countries such as India and Qatar to advocate for their support. Can Ukraine swing the global south? What tools and leverage does Kyiv have over New Delhi, Brasília, or Jakarta? And amid these efforts, what are Ukraine’s plans to maintain Western support? Join Minister Dzhaparova in conversation with FP’s Ravi Agrawal as they discuss a crucial angle in the continuing war in Ukraine. Indian analysts are fiercely debating whether India, too, should have reached out to the Taliban earlier when the group needed New Delhi’s recognition. Amar Sinha, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, said he had argued in favor of talks with the Taliban in September last year. “Once the two sides, that is the Afghan government and the Taliban, sat together, then of course we should have reached out to them,” Sinha said. “Why not when everyone else is speaking to them? We should engage with them, like we do with any other faction.” India’s foreign ministry was unreachable for comment, and it is unclear whether the Indian delegation met with the Taliban representatives, as reported in the Indian press. India’s external affairs ministry denied the reports but said the Indian government was in touch with “various stakeholders.” India’s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar was in Russia and Iran at the same time the Taliban delegation was visiting for talks with the representatives of the Afghan government. He discussed India’s concerns with his Iranian and Russian counterparts. The Indian government is not alone. Russia, Iran, and China are also worried about spillover from an extended Afghan civil war, including a large-scale refugee crisis. India, however, is in the most disadvantageous position. While Russia, China, and Iran started talking to the Taliban years ago, to be better able to address their concerns directly with the group if it returned to power, India stuck to its principled opposition to the group and stood by its allies in the Afghan government. During a visit to Kabul in 2016, Syed Akbar Agha, a cousin of Mullah Syed Tayyab Agha who was the former chief of the Taliban’s Doha office, told me that the Taliban were happy to reconcile with India. “We have no problems with Hindustan,” Agha had said. “In fact we want to send them a message of peace and friendship.” The group was relaying its message through various informal channels at a time when a relationship with India would have given the Taliban legitimacy in the international community. In 2018, two former Indian ambassadors visited Russia as observers of Russia’s regional forum on Afghanistan with the Taliban in attendance. According to a source present at the talks, the Taliban had then reached out to the Indian diplomats directly and expressed a will to mend fences. Now, as they score victories in the battlefield, their tone has changed drastically and lost that placating touch. Now, as a civil war in Afghanistan seems imminent and even Indian experts agree that the Afghan government’s writ will be limited to urban centers, New Delhi has reportedly been scrambling to send reconciliatory messages to the Taliban—messages that have thus far gone unanswered. Atmar also met with the Indian National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval in New Delhi to discuss the latest developments in the ongoing peace talks. During the meeting, Atmar discussed Afghanistan's government peace plan and stressed that only an Islamic Republic can ensure lasting internal peace and freedom. NSA Doval expressed India's support for the ongoing peace talks and stressed the need for continued strategic cooperation between the two countries. The two sides discussed several development projects, including the construction of rail lines between Central Asia and South Asia via Afghanistan. Atmar and Jaishankar stressed the development of Chabahar port, which India is constructing in partnership with Iran. Both sides also reviewed the recent talks at the Troika Peace Summit in Moscow, where representatives of the Afghan government, the Taliban, Pakistan, China, Russia, and the United States met to discuss the stalled peace talks. Afghanistan Foreign Minister Mohammed Haneef Atmar, who is on a three-day visit to India, met with his Indian counterpart Dr. S. Jaishankar today in New Delhi. The two leaders discussed scores of bilateral issues, including expansion of relations and strengthening of ""regional and international consensus on Afghan peace talks"". According to a press release issued by the Afghan Foreign Ministry, Atmar presented ""good wishes"" and a message from Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani to the leadership of India. Atmar also expressed gratitude towards India on behalf of his country for investing approximately $3 billion in development projects over the past two decades. Atmar arrived at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International airport on March 22, where he was received by senior government officials and state dignitaries. Apart from meeting Indian Foreign Minister Dr. S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval, Atmar is also expected to meet the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Afghan diplomat has come to discuss the Afghan peace process and the upcoming regional forums on peace and development in Afghanistan. Great to meet with Indian NSA my dear friend Ajit Doval today. Great discussion on our cooperation in political, security & economic spheres. We stressed the need for enhanced bilateral & regional coop on addressing common security challenges & achieving lasting peace in 🇦🇫. pic.twitter.com/s5Ewbbwd9X Minister Atmar, who arrived in India on March 22, comes amid the re-ignition of intra-Afghan talks that had begun in September 2020 but was stalled over the prisoners' exchange issue. New Delhi was recently named as one of the direct stakeholders by the United States in the Afghan conflict, which makes the visit even more important. Experts suggest that the purpose of Atmar’s visit is to seek India’s support on behalf of Ashraf Ghani, who doesn’t want to see an interim government being formed in the country with the Taliban members as constituents, which Washington had recently suggested. Arrived in beautiful & historic city of Delhi for a 3-day working visit. Look forward to holding talks with FM @DrSJaishankar & senior govt officials of 🇮🇳 on #AfghanPeaceProcess, upcoming regional forums on peace & development in 🇦🇫, security & economic cooperation. So grateful to my dear friend @DrSJaishankar for hosting us! Discussed our deep cultural ties & held excellent talks on advancing #AFG peace, strengthening 🇦🇫🇮🇳 strategic partnership & boosting regional connectivity thru increased trade, eco coop & trans-Afghan railway projects. pic.twitter.com/y1CVF7XpRn US envoy for peace in Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad meets Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation in Kabul, Afghanistan March 1, 2021.

Discussed latest developments pertaining to peace talks. We will remain in touch. The letter called for setting up two mechanisms. First, Blinken suggested a regional conference under the United Nations’ auspices with foreign ministers of six countries – US, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and India – to discuss a “unified approach” on Afghanistan. When Khalilzad was in Kabul from March 1-4, he hand-delivered a letter from the secretary of state, Anthony Blinken. It informed the top Afghan leadership that the US was still reviewing its Afghan policy, but it also wanted to accelerate the pace of the peace process. On Sunday evening, Indian external affairs minister S. Jaishankar tweeted that he had got a call from Khalilzad, in which they “discussed latest developments pertaining to peace talks”.

Photo: Twitter/US4AfghanPeace However, India is only likely to publicly say that it wants peace in Afghanistan and will participate in any process ‘constructively’. Its statement is expected to be within the paradigm of its support for an ‘Afghan-centric, Afghan-led’ initiative. This was an appropriate line to say in an elected legislature, but onlookers knew that his remarks were aimed at another faraway audience. That was Ghani’s response to a letter brought by the US’s special envoy on Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, on the steps that would herald the imminent inclusion of the Taliban in a new interim set-up. Instead, Indian officials still think that the best option is to engage with Afghan leaders who will take part in the negotiations so that India’s interests are not damaged. Secondly, the letter suggested a redux of the ‘Bonn conference’ with a national dialogue between the Taliban and Afghan government leaders hosted in Turkey. In his opening speech, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the foreign minister of host Qatar, asked the Afghan parties to keep an open mind during the talks. Welcoming the talks, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the “peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled”. Negotiations to broker a comprehensive peace deal were envisaged in a troop withdrawal pact signed between the US and the Taliban in February. In his opening remarks, Pakistan’s foreign minister warned the Afghans against foreign meddling in their negotiations. Turkey’s foreign minister hailed the peace talks, describing them as a real chance for peace in Afghanistan, and calling for a fair and lasting deal at the end of the process. The Doha talks should “respect national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, promote human rights and democracy, ensure interest of minorities, women and the vulnerable, effectively address violence across the country,” Jaishankar later tweeted. Historic peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government have opened in Qatar, with the warring parties meeting face-to-face for the first time to end nearly two decades of conflict. They are also expected to discuss constitutional changes and power-sharing during the talks in Doha, where the Taliban maintains a political office. In the negotiations that begin on Monday, the Afghan sides are expected to tackle issues including terms of a permanent ceasefire, the rights of women and minorities, and the disarming of tens of thousands of Taliban fighters and militias loyal to warlords, some of them aligned with the government. At the opening ceremony of the talks in Doha on Saturday, top diplomats from several other countries, including the United States, and representatives from global bodies such as the United Nations, made their opening remarks, many of them virtually because of the coronavirus restrictions. During his visit, Lavrov met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and briefed him on the situation in Ukraine, including the ongoing peace negotiations. The statement went on to add that the two ministers discussed the developments pertaining to Ukraine and the situation in Afghanistan, in addition to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.

Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) April 1, 2022 ""Prime Minister reiterated his call for early cessation of violence and conveyed India's readiness to contribute in any way to the peace efforts. The Russian Foreign Minister also updated the Prime Minister on the progress of decisions taken during the India-Russia bilateral Summit held in December 2021,"" a statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also conveyed his assessment of the recent conference on Afghanistan in China during the closed-door meeting. During the press conference, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said India can mediate between Moscow and Kyiv if New Delhi ""sees to play that role which provides resolution of the problem"". He added, ""Negotiations will continue. You heard from our negotiators about the last round of negotiations in Istanbul, where the Ukrainian side put on paper their understanding of the agreement that has to be reached. These agreements should be finalised. We are coming up with a response. Prior to the meeting, Lavrov had said during a special briefing that developing strategic partnerships with India has been Russia's priority, adding that the two countries have ""intensified"" their bilateral context. Referring to Ukraine, EAM Jaishankar emphasised the importance of cessation of violence and ending hostilities. Differences and disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy and by respect for international law, the UN Charter, sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, he said. ""Different countries are going to have their own relationship with the Russian Federation. It is a fact of history. It is a fact of geography. That is not something that we are seeking to change,"" Price had said during a press briefing in Washington."

Foreign Secretary assures no Indian will be left behind in conflict-hit Sudan First of all,I would like to thank Mr.Zainab Sikandar.Inspite of negative journalism prevalant at the moment,Mr.Sikandar has stood out & has shown the way – what honest journalism is !.I fully agree with his observation about Mr. Rahul Gandhi.I am so optimistic,that I have started visualising future leader in Mr.Gandhi.we don’t want scholar or brilliant orator to lead the country.We need an honest & big hearted leader who will be empathetic to the miseries of  large population of our countrymen. Under his leadership country will blossom into prosperity. In fact the press note of Aarogya Setu thanked Alderson for engaging with them. “We thank the ethical hacker on engaging with us. We encourage any users who identify a vulnerability to inform us immediately.” Alderson, however, maintained that the app should “stop lying, stop denying”. Rahul Gandhi is the eternal unputdownable comeback kid. He has managed to hold the attention of the media by continuously participating in the process of finding answers to the problems that Covid has thrown at India. He has had two conversations with two economists par excellence, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee. Add to this, the migrant aid pack that Sonia Gandhi offered, where the Congress party would have paid the train fare for every migrant labourer who wants to go home. This “masterstroke” has made the fiercest of critics of the Congress party applaud the Gandhis. The Gandhis are consciously and conspicuously placing themselves polar opposite to Narendra Modi. Whatever Modi is avoiding, the Gandhis are accepting and dealing squarely. Well, the media never stops in trying to showcase RaGa sometimes as mature, serene, zen like, etc but truth cannot be hidden and pappu can’t become suddenly intellectual. Arre, at least tag “sponsored” content properly. Went thru the advertorial before realising what it is. Honest journalism. Republic, Times Now, News 18, India Today. Honest journalists .Arnab goswamy, Rahul Siva Sankar, Navika Kumar,  Anand Narasimhan, Rahul Kanwar. They are not only honest but fearless Rahul Gandhi is an oracle. His prophetic words about the app came true. Agree 100% with zainab. Ji. Well wishes of Rahul farji Gandhi, like Sonia sena, Ghulams, Shekar Gupta etc must know that Raul Farji Gandhi will never be P M of India no Chance. People are not willing to have a Dumbo, Buffoon, looters, Cheaters, divider as PM. Shekar Gupta should use his good office and get back all the looted and cheated money of poor people from sonia Sena , associates and ghulams from many decades. Shekar guitar you are seen as a power broker not as a journal. India needs fair, non-hyphenated and questioning journalism, packed with on-ground reporting. ThePrint – with exceptional reporters, columnists and editors – is doing just that. Ahmed it seems. It’s okay you can use your real name which is pathetic IT cell coolie. Here’s your 2 bucks for the comment. Manickam Tagore, Lok Sabha MP from Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu, who is  vocal about his views regarding party deserters, told Frontline that the party wanted to go to the people through the Bharat Jodo Yatra. Its aim was to “unite for India”. He was confident that there was no danger of the Congress coming apart, despite the spate of resignations. He believed the recent resignations would affect only the newspaper-reading political class. Rahul Gandhi strongly felt that party workers should go out to the people and the yatra was being held in that spirit. Manickam Tagore said Rahul Gandhi’s engagement with members of civil society, including those who have been critical of the Congress, was a meaningful one. Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal. Please abide to our community guidelines for posting your comment In his letter to Sonia Gandhi, Azad wrote of his deep loyalty to the party from his student days and expressed disaffection with the current leadership, namely former party president Rahul Gandhi. He detailed all the posts he had held since the mid 1970s, saying he joined the party at a time when to be associated with the party drew stigma. He was referring to the Emergency without actually stating it. He wrote he had the “honour of serving as a Union Minister” in the governments of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh. He pointed out that Sonia Gandhi as party president was able to steer two successful terms in government for the UPA because she “heeded the wise counsel of senior leaders, besides trusting their judgment and delegating powers to them”. He accused Rahul Gandhi of being responsible for demolishing the party’s consultative mechanism after he was appointed vice president in 2013. He castigated Rahul Gandhi for tearing up a government ordinance in full public view, describing it as “childish behaviour”, which, he said, contributed to the defeat of the UPA government in 2014. The UPA government, he said, was then already under an offensive from right-wing forces and unscrupulous corporate interests. Raghu Ram Rajan, why he left RBI is quite clear. He had wanted Modi Government to continue him, Is it not a sarcasm that Ram in BJPhad to leave the nation. Well maintained economy & his approach towards NPA, are the real reasons.         Moreover while demonetisation declared he openly made contrasting statements. Even to last& present FM he on off warned the regression of economy, downfall of progress, GDP but the government was not ready accept the economy of India has not given due care . He once made statement that unless the government accepts there is downfall, then there is scope to prepare for the same. IMF just took him on the advisory board.Why not Modi Government? Even A.Banerji asked govt. to to pour money in the market as the way possible. Even by increasing printing, if not How is possible the stoppage of economy wheels get speed . Rajan clearly recommended to pour 65000crore , once a governor of Gr. RBI. He is not critic but real intergrity towards nation & Economy. In India Manmohan Singh who revived In India Economy, Monteksingh Ahuluwalia. Mr. Rangarajan, Abhiji Chattargi, Amartya Sen, the noble laourets . More efficient. real Ecomist . Not IAS in history. Like MrDas limited knowledge & Govt. hand doll Raghuram Rajan should come out in the open and join the Congress. His anti Modi, pro Congress stand is well known.  Why does he not just be honest about it? Being a good economist is not enough. One must also have character and depth as part of one’s persona. Think over   No freebess, waste of money.no value.

Raghuram Rajan and Rahul Gandhi spoke about the problems the country is facing and the possible solutions. While Rahul was frank in his observations of inequalities having increased over the decades, Raghuram Rajan spoke as an independent economist — as a professional. The world is facing an unprecedented era of uncertainty and gloom. At the very beginning of the pandemic, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party had made it very clear that we are here in solidarity with the Narendra Modi government and will help find answers. The government implemented some of the suggestions made by Sonia Gandhi, P. Chidambaram and Rahul Gandhi. A responsible leader does not wait for a calamity to take its toll and then lord over the debris of what is left behind. Rajan was the man who had warned against the unfolding subprime crisis in the US. It unfolded into a global financial crisis. Clearly, his credentials as an economist were never in doubt. India needs fair, non-hyphenated and questioning journalism, packed with on-ground reporting. ThePrint – with exceptional reporters, columnists and editors – is doing just that. Mr Premji asserted that he stands by his recent comments on moonlighting being a complete violation of integrity ""in its deepest form"". Separating such cases from those where employees secretly worked for competitors, the Wipro top boss made it clear ""there is no space for someone to work for Wipro and competitor XYZ and they would feel exactly the same way if they were to discover the same situation."" ""That is what I meant...so I do stand by what I said...I do think it is violation of integrity if you are moonlighting in that shape and form,"" he said. Infosys' internal communication titled ""no double lives"" made it clear that ""dual employment is not permitted as per...Employee Handbook and Code of Conduct"". Reforms in Indian bureaucracy by allowing lateral entry at the post of joint secretary in some ministries for interested people from the private sector, doing away with the need for attestation of documents from gazetted officers, bringing in the system of self-attestation of documents, doing away with the interview requirement of “class 3” and “class 4” jobs in the government space and making these appointments solely on the basis of marks of written examination, have been excellent steps by Modi after he became prime minister. But even when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, zero tolerance for corruption, eradicating irrelevant paperwork and ease of living including ease of applying for government jobs, were the highlights of the Gujarat model.

The Congress leaders explained that the vaccine procurement rules in India currently allow central and state governments, hospitals and industries to directly procure vaccines. The Karnataka Congress has demanded that it be given this permission as well, they said. Very good move, Congress or any other party and organizations, if they come up with this kind of helping hand.Now Congress is prepared a plan to directly procure vaccines from the manufacturers and administer them to the people. Hope there will not be any political hindrance again by ruling party. Also please note this initiative  dear citizens/voters/taxpayers. Keep up your Good thoughts Mr. DKS and S.R. and take care of Karnataka'ns. ""We just need two small permissions – one from the central government and one from the state government – and appeal to the BJP not to let politics come in the way and in the spirit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat allow Congress to directly procure and administer vaccines,’’ they said. Sanjay, you are right about looted money as the funding for MLA's comes from BJP government. Why waste money, all we need is GOBAR & GAUMUTRA which is free. Same money Shah can buy MLAs from to topple Maha Govt. Not frm any political party my Opinion let them send the amount direct to state folks account tht will much better AP STATE FREE OF COVID Treatment Of course. My answer is an unequivocal yes. This is why we wrote to the Prime Minister giving positive and concrete suggestions and repeatedly offering help. The Congress Party has years of experience in government and disaster management. Even Maharashtra, despite the onslaught of pandemic, has left no stone unturned and the results have just started showing in flattening of the curve of surging infections. Overall, the attitude of governance has to be transparent, accountable, facilitative, cooperative and supportive in crisis rather than opaque, aggressive and heartless. Firstly, the virus is everywhere. For the last one year, the Congress Party has extended its full cooperation to the government. We believe that fighting Covid is not a “You versus Us” battle but is a “Us versus Corona” battle. This battle is, therefore, beyond political alignments. We have to fight this battle together as a nation. The Modi government must realise that the battle is against Covid, it is not against the Congress or other political opponents."

Diplomatic relations between India and Nepal have worsened over the past few months, with both countries claiming that the areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas are part of their territory. Nepal maintains that India has claimed the disputed region by building a link road despite repeated objections. India, on the other hand, has said that the road falls within its territory. “North Bihar gets ravaged by floods because of heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of Nepal,” Kumar told Modi. “In accordance with an agreement between India and Nepal, the water resources department of Bihar conducts the flood management work in the bordering areas. But we have not been receiving full cooperation from Nepal in the past few years.” Rivers originating in Nepal have inundated several areas in Bihar. The Maharashtra government on Monday demanded setting up of a committee under Modi to tackle crisis situations in states, PTI reported. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray also sought immediate assistance from the Centre for Maharashtra, to mitigate the adverse impact of Cyclone Nisarga, which hit the state on June 3, causing much damage in coastal districts. In June, the Nepal Parliament approved a bill demarcating the Lipulekh mountain pass, Kalapani and Limpiadora as its territory. Earlier this month, Oli claimed that the Indian government and his political rivals were plotting to oust him from power. Karnataka Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters the state asked for Rs 4,000-crore assistance to handle the flood situation, PTI reported. “As per the initial assessment Rs 4,000 crore loss has occurred,” Bommai said. “It is a preliminary estimate because rains are continuing. A proper survey has to be done.” Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the standing committee did not seek the opinion of any independent environmentalist nor of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. It only called on people from the Ministry of Jal Shakti (Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation), the Ministry of External Affairs and representatives of the state governments of Assam and Kerala. The MPs were told the main problem of dealing with floods in Kerala was the slow pace of clearances for dam projects by the environment ministry. They still did not call anyone from the ministry. But the politicians are clearly aware of the protests sparked by displacement and environmental destruction. When officials argued for creating reservoirs along with run-of-the-river hydroelectric dams in Arunachal Pradesh and claimed this would help manage floods, the committee responded with caution, stressing the need for environmental assessments. The standing committee’s own deliberations on the IWT display exactly why it would be difficult. Much of the discussion is devoted to why water from the rivers allotted to India’s use is “allowed to flow into Pakistan”, thus being “underutilised”. This view is incompatible with looking at the health of a river basin as a whole. Maybe the most striking omission on environmental assessment is the lack of assessment of dams in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. The report has a section on “Flash Floods, Cloud Burst and Glacial Outburst and Landslides”. It mentions the Chamoli disaster in February 2021, when a massive rock and ice fall led to a flash flood. Most of the deaths and damage happened at unfinished hydropower projects. Given that these are seen as “force multipliers” of damage, it seems counterintuitive to offer them as solutions. The Parliamentary Standing Committee did not discuss this, which is an issue of fundamental concern. If hydropower dams are not financially viable, why are they being built? And if the “solution” being offered is heightened costs (building reservoirs) and less profit-centric water release (keeping some volume empty as a buffer), why will they be built? Who will fund the costs? Aren’t there less costly ways to deal with floods without adding long-term lossmaking enterprises to the Indian budget? The frustration of officials with the failure of state governments, particularly Bihar, in the matter of floodplain zoning is evident. This is captured most clearly by a comment by a member of the Jal Shakti ministry to the Parliamentary Standing Committee: “Floodplain zoning is a concept central to floodplain management. Whenever floods actually occur, the damage can be minimised, if not avoided. Although this approach is generally endorsed by all in principle, scant attention is given to it in actual practice, leading to increased flood damages.” The ministry focuses on its other three recommendations. It totally ignores the failure of embankments to protect people from floods despite decades of embankment building. Bihar has 3,800 kilometres of embankments, and is still ravaged by floods. The history of cooperation with Nepal on the Kosi is one of significant failure, resentment on both sides of the border, and enduring misery for people on the ground. A clue to the exclusion of Nepal may lie in the causes of floods, according to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, and the solutions the bureaucrats offer. For a report on floods, the committee is remarkably silent on women. Due to the socially restricted roles of women in the country, they are often the caretakers of homes. It is their domain that is most affected, and they are at most risk due to displacement. Flooding also adds to issues such as open air defecation and access to sanitation facilities, all of which become more difficult for women. To cite just one example, approximately 40% of Indian women – compared with 12% of men – suffer from urinary tract infections once in their lifetime. This particular standing committee on water resources focussing on floods was set up in 2019-20 but could not deliver its report in the stipulated period. When the committee reconvened for 2020-21 it added “International Water Treaties in the field of Water Resource Management with particular reference to Treaty/Agreement entered Into with China, Pakistan and Bhutan” to its scope. The addition goes unexplained but the approach of the report is wide-angle, and looks at flooding not just as a local issue, but one impacted by changes across river basins. This is a positive sign; it indicates a broadening of approach from the local problem of floods to a wider perspective on the issues involved in dealing with rivers, including transboundary issues. This ignores the history of the treaty, which was conceptualised for managing the basin as a whole at first. The concept was changed to allocating the water of three rivers to each of the two countries because of political hostility. Even this agreement was reached only after the World Bank promised massive financial support. It is hard to imagine that the two countries would be willing to enter difficult negotiations, which would inevitably involve a great deal of compromise with all its attendant domestic political costs, at this time. Aware of the operational impasse during the flood season in 2020, Bihar’s Chief Minister Nitish Kumar visited the Jainagar weir site in Madhubani, and upon sensing the seriousness of the situation, instructed the Water Resources Department to explore converting the weir on the India-Nepal border into an efficiently operated barrage. It is evident that Nepal’s attitude towards mutual issues (water sharing, flood control, etc.) has been short of collaboration, unlike in the past. But despite the requisite permission for movement on the Kosi barrage and associated embankments, the movement of departmental vehicles and work activities did not draw the attention of the Kosi Project Authority, Biratnagar, for various reasons. Since bilateral cooperation remains the fulcrum of water sharing and water management between the two countries, Nepal must play its part in ensuring a sustainable way forward. The Minister of Water Resources Department, Bihar, Sanjay Kumar Jha, met the Minister of External Affairs, S. Jaishankar, in September 2020 to highlight long-standing water sharing issues with Nepal. The crucial matter of water sharing with Nepal has been flagged by India officially as well. What is evident is Nepal’s lack of prompt reciprocation. It is essential that Nepal shows the required will to find a long-term solution with India in ending a perennial disaster. During the strengthening work proposed on the right marginal bund on the Lalbekia river, the local Nepali administration claimed that the said bund area fell in no man’s land. This is notwithstanding the fact that the embankment was built by India 30 years ago and there has not been any dispute regarding its maintenance all these years. Breach closure/protective work of right guide bund of the Kamla weir remains incomplete due to the lack of permission. However, resolution of the impasse is awaited. This is another important matter to be looked at. Ashok Karki, the mayor of Belka Municipality, said that no measures were effective to control the erosion. Flooding and erosion started around Dumribote and Sisaulighat after the flood of Koshi breached the embankment and entered the settlement. “Sisaulighat became an island after Koshi broke the embankment and entered the settlements. I have come here by boat,"" he said, "" Sisaulighat is at the highest risk. Here more than 150 households are at risk.” He said that the Bhatepul area of ward no ​​3 is more at risk. Mayor Karki said that since last May, the disaster could not be prevented despite several efforts to avert the risk of possible floods. He said that as the flood increased only in the first week of June, he appealed to the provincial and federal governments to avoid possible inundation and erosion, but in spite of plans being made to protect the settlement, the problem became serious after the flood destroyed the embankment. Mayor Karki said that they are now focusing on preventing human and property damage. ""Right now, we are focusing on how to prevent the loss of life and property,"" he said. Ari Lal Urab, a resident of Belka-3, said, ""Even though Koshi has been eroding lands for a few days, the government did not take action."" Even before 2045 BS, Koshi flowed in the human settlement where the Koshi has now entered, demolishing the embankment. After the 2045 BS earthquake, the course of Koshi gradually shifted eastward. People started settling in the parts left by the river in 2051. Kisan Rai, another resident of Belka-3, said, ""I had never thought that such a disaster would happen. Even before 2040 BS, Koshi had caused pain in the present settlement. Later we thought that it would be calm after Koshi was pushed to the east.” Recently, the locals were panicking as the river had continuously eroded land for two days. A year ago, a team led by Home Minister Balkrishna Khand conducted an on-site inspection of the Saptakoshi dam on Wednesday. At that time, it was not considered a matter of serious concern. This year, as Saptakoshi changed its course, the residents of five wards of Belka in Udayapur had to face a big disaster. Apart from Belka, two municipalities of Saptari, Saptakoshi and Kanchanpur, have also been affected by Koshi. Residents of Sunsari's Barahakshetra Municipality-6 and 9 have also been affected by Koshi. The Chief Minister of Province 1, Rajendra Kumar Rai, has expressed concern over the destruction of the embankment and the entry of Koshi into human settlements. He has called upon the residents of the river banks to leave the risky places and move to safer places as much as possible. He instructed the local administration, local government and people's representatives, security personnel, Red Cross and other agencies to be aware of the damage that may occur when the river enters human settlements and to join in the relief and rescue operations. Bihar of India also has to bear the damage caused by the Saptakoshi flood. Koshi floods cause loss of property in Bihar every year. Birendra Yadav, chief district officer of Udayapur, said that the families displaced by the Koshi have now requested the Nepal Red Cross and other organizations to arrange accommodation and short-term relief. According to him, coordination will be done with the Ministry of Home Affairs and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority to arrange a sustainable settlement for the displaced. Jira Rai, deputy mayor of Belka, said that the Chief District Officer, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force local chiefs have visited the flood-affected areas and conducted on-site monitoring and held a meeting of the Disaster Management Committee to plan for the future. She said that along with Udayapur's Belka, the breach of the western embankment impacted as far as Kunaul in India. The British had embanked the Damodar Valley in Bengal in 1855 on an experimental basis for flood control, which failed miserably. Hence, they gave up the idea. Moreover, the British engineer, Bradshaw Smith informed in Patna Conference of 1937 that embankments invited disaster but he was ignored. The folly of Damodar did not deter the new poltical leaders of independent India and Bhar to propose to embank Kosi which was initially rejected by the Centre which mooted for the construction of a dam instead. The Government however lacked the resources to spend for a dam and with the floods of 1953, the issue was resolved by the sanctioning of the embankment construction. However, to give this idea a technical legitimacy, CWPC engineers were sent to China to study the impact of embankments in Hwang Ho. They cleverly ignored the thousands of instances of breach and inundation of Hwang Ho and its change of course and suggested to embank Kosi. What must be noted is that engineers from USA, China were brought to vouch for taming Kosi while the renowned hydrological expert, Sir Claude Inglis of UK refused to certify. Interestingly, the then President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, also from Bihar had changed his anti-embankment views to appeal to Biharis to help embank Kosi. Hence began the taming of the Sorrow of Bihar which has brought in greater sorrows over the years. The Frankestein of corruption has hit Bihar very hard ever since the faulty project of embanking Kosi had been sanctioned in 1950s. Political corruption and poor flood management have been in Bihar ever since. Neither the Nitish led government nor the Laloo led one could extricate Bihar from the clutches of poor disaster management. News and opinion website that brings you reports and narrative from a perspective often ignored or suppressed by the mainstream media of India. The year 2020 has been a year of mourning due to the spread of COVID-19 while also being subjected to the vagaries of human interference with nature causing severe floods as one can witness in Bihar and Odisha. Hence, the way ahead for Bihar will be to learn from these international experiences and allow greater space for its rivers through an integrated flood management system and not meddle with their course on the advise of the skewed knowledge of the engineers or the politicians who never go to the field except during scrunity or before elections and lack the connect with the communities suffering the most from their decisions. This play of politics has played with innumerable lives and caused great loss of property ever since. This has also been another reason for distress outmigration from Bihar. The construction of embankments also led to the rise of criminal-politician nexus to feed on the money allocated for flood protection in Bihar and use the bricks of the Kosi project to contruct their own houses. The rivers of Bihar are Ghaghra, Gandak, Budhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kamala, Bhutani Balan, Kosi and Mahananda, of which Kosi is considered to be the ‘Sorrow of Bihar’ as it causes havoc during monsoons. A sneak peak into the data of the impact of floods can be found in the tables below. The 1990s era and 2000s caused significant loss in Bihar due to floods. The Dutch government had appealed to Nitish Kumar to spare Patna Collectorate from demolition, which is one of the last remnants of dutch history in Patna, a strong collaboration can be forged between the two for flood management especially for Kosi and Gandak which were compelled to change their course over years. It is difficult to imagine the LEOC — a pink building with a tall radio antenna — submerged in the flood waters. However, scars from the earlier flood season remain visible on the building’s ground level, which is barricaded. On a cold December morning, Khagendra Mandal led us to a portion of an embankment in Launiya village in Nepal’s Saptari District. Pointing to a spot overrun by weeds and fraying sandbags, he described how the people of Launiya rallied together on a rainy night in the monsoon of 2019 to stop the onslaught of the Khado River. Unfortunately, even among the most cooperative of countries, multilateral efforts to combat climate change are difficult because national leaders worry about sacrificing sovereignty, insincere international partners and/or domestic backlashes. These problems are exacerbated in South Asia, arguably the least integrated and most geopolitically dysfunctional region in the world. That India and Pakistan are engaged in backchannel track 2 diplomacy is the worst kept secret in South Asia. It does not take a vivid imagination to guess what dominates the agenda at these talks: Kashmir, terrorism, trade, perhaps crisis behavior under the shadow of nuclear weapons. Welcome as such conversations are, they are almost assuredly lacking focus on the biggest crisis facing the region’s inhabitants: climate change. The idea of sworn enemies putting their economies in the hands of the other seems fanciful and foolish, nigh on suicidal. Haven’t we received lesson enough from the Russia-Ukraine war that relying on geopolitical rivals for energy is perilous? To be sure, despite an Indian prime minister recently outlining the precursor to such an idea, no reasonable observer would bet that South Asia is ready for such deep engagement, stricken as it is by decades of wars, threats, mistrust and ugly nationalism. Cooperation on water and air within countries, among provinces and states, has proved hard enough, let alone across rancorous international borders. Separately, the political economy of many South Asian societies has bequeathed vast amounts of wealth and political capital in the hands of real-estate magnates, who often stand in the way of sensible policy adjustment to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its sixth report on the state of the earth’s climate in early August — and it paints a dire picture. The report argues that unless governments take appropriate measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions and spur behavioral change, the world is moving toward a climate crisis of rising sea levels, warmer temperatures and more extreme weather. The report’s findings are particularly relevant in Bangladesh, where low elevation, high population density and weak infrastructure make it highly vulnerable to climate change. By its nature, the climate crisis is transnational. A glacier melting in one locale changes agriculture in many others. Rivers that gather apace in one country flood another: the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, the three big rivers in the region, each span several countries. Air sheds, in which pollution circulates, do not respect political boundaries, evinced by cities across the subcontinent — like Kabul, Lahore, New Delhi and Dhaka — suffering severe air catastrophes. On July 1, 2016, Bangladeshi militants carried out an attack, targeting mostly foreigners and non-Muslims, at the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi government responded to the attack with a concerted and controversial counterterrorism campaign. Although the number of terrorist incidents has been in steady decline since 2016, Islamist groups continue to operate, recruit, and carry out small-scale attacks while aspiring to perpetrate greater violence. This report examines the dynamics, drivers, and manifestations of extremism in Bangladesh and discusses measures to weaken its appeal. This year has served as a living, heaving reminder of the World Bank’s dire warnings about climate change in the region. Pakistan’s flooding has led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis: thousands dead, tens of millions homeless, millions of acres of food lost, and tens of billions of dollars’ worth of damages. Few witnesses to the country’s apocalyptic floods in 2010 could have foreseen that barely a decade later, their experience would be surpassed. Instead, states (India’s and Pakistan’s Punjabs, say) and cities can lead the way. Municipal authorities, especially, are on the frontlines of the battles over water, electricity and pollution, and must be at the forefront of discussions on climate. After all, if Arctic cities spread across eight countries can institutionalize meetings at the mayoral level, why not Himalayan cities such as Kabul, Peshawar, Kathmandu and Srinagar? However, such customary laws are not recognised by the state. Because these are not recognised and not written either, the policy makers responsible for deciding the best possible applications of such resources — held in common by the rural communities — are bound to be ill-informed. This non-recognition is equally disruptive for the existing social relationships within the villages. Most of the pasture land traditionally used by people from Sarhi is falling in the Kanha National Park since 2008."

Currently, the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and the local police in Narmada manages the SoU premises. However, with the statue gaining popularity among tourists from different parts of the world, officials said that the government has been looking at a more “professional” management of crowd. “The Narmada Dam is already a sensitive installation and so is SoU now. So, the CISF will also have a permanent dog squad stationed in Kevadia for the statue,” the official added. The personnel will soon be joined by their families, according to officials. “Right now, they have been asked to report individually but we have assigned barracks to them keeping in mind that their families will move here with them eventually once the provisions are in place for schooling of their wards and other such needs,” the official said. An official said, “The CISF is trained to handle installations and movement of people like in airports. They also manage the Taj Mahal. They ensure smooth movement. Unlike the local police that sometimes gets into verbal spat with visitors during heavy rush days. The deployment of CISF will take away the load from the SRPF and the police that have other peripheral projects around the SoU to supervise.” The official added that the CISF has been given the security charge of SoU keeping in mind the sensitivity to terror attacks. The official added that the number of personnel needed at the site was decided following multiple visits by teams of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs as well as the CISF. “They considered the number of access points, entry for visitors, unmanned exits and other possible ways to venture in and out. Teams came from New Delhi as well as Navi Mumbai because this falls under the Western Zone of CISF,” said the official. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is all set to take over the security charge of Statue of Unity — world’s tallest statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with a height of 182 metre — located in Kevadia in Narmada district. On Monday, the first batch of CISF personnel arrived in Kevadia and underwent Covid-19 antigen tests as part of the protocols. Officials said that the personnel tested negative but have been sent to self-quarantine for seven days, following which, an installation ceremony will be held. As part of the National Unity Day or Rashtriya Ekta Diwas celebrations, ""Ekta Parade"" was held at Kevadia, where police personnel from across the country along with Border Security Force, ITBP, CISF and CRPF took part.

Activists affiliated with 'Human Rights and Peace Society Nepal' holding placards protest against the alleged encroachment of Nepal border by India in far west of Nepal, near the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu, Nepal May 12, 2020. India and Nepal are at a row after the Indian side issued a new political map incorporating Kalapani and Lipulekh on its side of the border in October last year. Thetension further escalated  after Indiainaugurated a road link connecting Kailash Mansarovar , a holy pilgrimage site situated at Tibet, China, that passes through the territory belonging to Nepal. Gyawali last week summoned the Indian Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra and handed over a diplomatic note to him to protest against the construction of a key road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand. However, senior Nepal Communist Party and member of Nepal Communist Party Standing Committee Ganesh Shah said the new move may escalate unnecessary tension between Nepal and India at a time when the country is fighting thecoronavirus . “The Nepal government should soon start a dialogue with India to resolve the matter through political and diplomatic moves,” he said. Nepal’s ruling Nepal Communist Party lawmakers have also tabled a special resolution in Parliament demanding return of Nepal’s territory in Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh. The new map was drawn on the basis of the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 signed between Nepal and then the British India government and other relevant documents, which suggests Limpiyadhura, from where the Kali river originated, is Nepal’s border with India, The Kathmandu Post quoted an official at the Ministry of Land Reform and Management as saying. President Bidhya Bhandari, addressing Parliament last week, reiterated that Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh belong to Nepal and appropriate diplomatic measures will be adopted to resolve the existing issues with India. The move announced by Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali came weeks after he said that efforts were on to resolve the border issue with India through diplomatic initiatives.

The United States is closely monitoring the situation following a fierce clash between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh and hopes that the differences will be resolved peacefully, reports PTI quoting officials. The military stand-off along India-China Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, particularly the violent clash in Galwan Valley, will make the negotiations between the two nations to resolve the boundary dispute all the more strenuous. Amid border tensions, India, China likely to hold joint secretary-level talks today In Ladakh, Indian analysts estimate, Chinese military has positioned itself to challenge road construction by India that could threaten Aksai Chin and NH 219, the tenuous Xinjiang-Tibet highway. Be that as it may, India’s foreign policy got co-related to the alliance with the US, and a belief grew, which the present government inherited, that a muscular approach towards China becomes sustainable and that is the language China will come to fear, now that the Sino-American tensions are also cascading. In Doklam, India feared that the Chinese road would give its military access to heights from where it could threaten the Siliguri Corridor, India’s tenuous link with its north-eastern regions. Meanwhile, provocative moves such as the presence of the Tibetan government-in-exile in India; the aggressive claims on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) and Gilgit Baltistan; talk of abandoning the ‘One China’ policy; the dalliance with the US over ‘Wuhan virus’; the challenge to the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor; and of course the overall lurch toward ‘Quad’ signalling an intention to bandwagon with the US’ containment strategy against China — all these were manifestations of such ‘testiness’. The Indian analysts have been comparing the military build-up in the India-China border in eastern Ladakh to the Doklam standoff in 2017. This was only to be expected since the leitmotif was once again a road construction in disputed border regions. Conceivably, some among the Indian bureaucratic elite would have facilitated this happening at a time when the UPA leadership of Manmohan Singh was getting battered and distracted and hopelessly besieged, and domestic politics had entered a turbulent phase signifying the Congress Party’s terminal sickness. The Americans should be eternally grateful to their war horses in the Indian wood work. Quite obviously, in the light of all these major shifts in Indian policies, China began to read a new meaning into the feverish road construction activities close to the LAC, the attempts to create feeder roads of the DSDBO leading to Aksai Chin and so on. The answer is, China no longer thinks that it can afford to take lightly the steady Indian build-up of military infrastructure in that region — known as Sub Sector North (which lies just to the east of Siachen glacier and is the only area that provides direct access to Aksai Chin from India.) An honest appraisal becomes difficult because it is entangled with the government’s decision on Article 370, which of course is cast in iron and is apparently irrevocable, as it is linked to the ruling elite’s ideology — plus, our ‘pivot’ to America, which is at the core of India’s foreign policy but about which our elites do not even want to talk about after Trump presented his mediatory offer to bring about India-China reconciliation, signalling his neutrality and disinterest in getting dragged into the current standoff. Why is China now all perked up when it was reconciled with the reopening of the Daulat Beg Oldie military base at the easternmost point of the Karakoram Range in a cold desert region in the far north of India, just 8 km south of the Chinese border and just 9 km northwest of the Aksai Chin Line of Actual Control between the two countries, and just 10 km from the Karakoram Pass that separates Tibet from Xinjiang? - MEA Spokesperson Anurag Shrivastava on OIC meeting over Jammu & Kashmir Foreign Ministry and PLA of China once again assert their claim to the entire Galwan Valley and demand that India s… https://t.co/QTcXrBtdry China is furtively and fervently encroaching our land in a steady manner much to the peril of Indian security and t… https://t.co/zsMbeCSKgH At a time after the recent #China-India border clash,  #PLA soldiers, especially those who were injured, can’t be f… https://t.co/wFFnoNFDUu Union Health Minister Dr Mansukh Mandaviya holds a virtual meeting with Indian Medical Association regarding… https://t.co/vxAdyYxiO1 The Backfire in Nepal: How India Lost Plot to China is a must-read for policy makers, journalists, researchers intending to know recent developments in India-Nepal relations, writes Rishi Gupta Many such questions seek an answer as one begins to unfurl the Roti-Beti relations between India and Nepal amidst ongoing India-Nepal fiasco. The book entitled The Backfire in Nepal: How India Lost Plot to China by US-based Nepali journalist Sanjay Upadhya helps find these answers. The book provides a detailed account of Nepal-India relations in the last fifteen years. In his previous books, Nepal and the Geo-Strategic Rivalry Between China and India from Routledge in 2012, and The Raj Lives: India in Nepal from Vitasta in 2008, Upadhya had carried ground-breaking works on India’s colonial past and its impact on Nepal, and Nepal’s geo-strategic location between two Asian giants. Unlike his previous research works, The Backfire in Nepal is a journalistic account of Nepal-India relations focusing on China’s diplomatic and strategic success in Nepal in recent years. While previous administrations in Nepal strike a balance between India and China including Prachanda who stood as a staunch critic of alleged Indian ‘expansionism’ since 1950, KP Oli has used India’s 2015 unofficial border blockade to his advantage in evoking ultra-nationalism based on anti-India manoeuvrings. Oli also holds India accountable for his ouster in 2016 from the Government, and with his present tenure, he continues to be revengeful. Meanwhile, post-December 13 dissolution of the Parliament, Oli was seen taking a moderate view of India. However, it changed very soon after he reiterated Kalapani, Lipulekh as Nepalese territories, and relocated Ayodhya in Nepal. In contrast, the “Chinese have acted purely on national interest”. There has been no compromise on China’s security concerns looming from a critical border between Tibet and Nepal. From cracking down the 2008 free-Tibet movement to the signing of Mutual Assistance Treaty in Criminal Matters in 2019, and Nepal’s unequivocal support to ‘One China Policy’, China has shown an uncompromised bargain in Nepal. On the other hand, India continues to misread how Beijing sees Nepal — both in terms of China’s visions of the past and the future. This complicates the core trilateral challenge: ensuring that Nepal is not sucked deeper into the Sino-Indian vortex, only to be scorned for aggravating the Asian giants’ rivalry. With the publication of a new political map, Nepal has toughened its stance on a row over a stretch of disputed land that lies at a strategic three-way junction with China and India. Delhi accuses Beijing of interfering. In addition, Nepal has an unresolved border dispute with China, following a joint communique between Chinese and Indian leaders at a May 2015 summit, which sought an expansion on trade between India and China via the controversial Lipu Lekh Pass. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal and India have become caught up in a border dispute, following competing territorial claims by both sides over controversial land in the Himalayan region. Swaran Singh, a professor at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, believes that the emergence of such a narrative has to do with India's complicated relationship with Beijing, which is also seeking relations with Pakistan and Nepal. The diplomatic landscape ""only reinforces allegations of Nepal becoming more emboldened to take a tough stand and use harsh language against India to please their Chinese friends,"" Singh told DW. The announcement, however, has strained diplomatic relations between India and Nepal, resulting in heated political exchange from both sides. The latest diplomatic spat between the two countries began to escalate after New Delhi announced on May 8 the inauguration of an 80-kilometer-long (50-mile) road that passes through Lipu Lekh, a disputed area that lies at a strategic three-way junction with Tibet and China. Read more: Nepal's delicate balancing act between China and India Analysts say the latest border dispute has given rise to nationalism in Nepal, serving as a lifeline to the embattled prime minister. Oli has faced mounting public criticism over his government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Also surfacing on Indian media platforms are allegations that Kathmandu has become a puppet of Beijing, with China's increasing economic activities in the region becoming a headache for India. ""I entirely reject the idea of dragging other countries in border disputes between Nepal and India. We had disputes with China on Lipu Lekh. And the issue is still pending,"" he told DW."

This came on a day the party expelled a close aide of dissident party leader Suvendu Adhikari, who resigned from the state cabinet last month. Banerjee had first spoken out against the party in July. “The rectification drive initiated by Mamata Banerjee will not succeed if action is taken against small fish and the big ones are allowed to go scot-free,” he said. Meanwhile, Adhikari’s associate Kanishka Panda, who was the secretary of the TMC’s Purba Medinipur district, was expelled. The Adhikari family represents two Lok Sabha seats and an assembly seat in the district. Speaking about the posters, Banerjee said, “I do not know who is putting up these posters. I have nothing to do with it and I don’t support it. I will also request you not to link me with Adhikari. It was his personal matter and the same applies to me. Differences can be discussed in the party in a democratic way.” TMC secretary-general and state education minister Partha Chatterjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor held an hour-long meeting with Banerjee at Chatterjee’s residence in south Kolkata in the afternoon.

I will be available if I am called for more meetings.” Mamata Banerjee fumes over BJP's 'insult to Tagore'; says 'Will hold rally in Birbhum' West Bengal Speaker accepts resignation of TMC-turned-BJP heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari On December 17, Suvendu Adhikari officially quit the Trinamool party on Thursday. Tendering his resignation to TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, he had also quit from his MLA post - which has now been accepted by Speaker Biman Banerjee. Adhikari - the mastermind of 2007 Nandigram agitation - holds influence in about 35 assembly constituencies in West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia, Jhargram and Birbhum districts. He had been creating rumours for the past few months by holding rallies not under Trinamool flag or its supremo - Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's posters, and had skipped cabinet meetings. After the breakdown of talks, Adhikari resigned from the cabinet post of Transport minister after quitting as Hooghly River Bridge Commission chairman, saying it was 'difficult to work in TMC'. Recalling his journey with Mamata Banerjee, Adhikari thundered, "" In 1999 I joined the TMC and we had a great role to bring a new wave. They are calling me traitor, what are they?  BJP will be the party that will form the party in 2019. where there is no faith, belief, why should I be there? Central Govt funds not letting to get for the people. If there won't be the same govt at the Centre and state, then West Bengal is lost"". Coronavirus LIVE Updates: India's tally at 1,00,55,560; flights from UK banned till Dec 31 On December 17, Suvendu Adhikari officially quit the Trinamool and joined BJP in presence of ex- BJP chief Amit Shah. In his letter after resignation, Adhikari blamed the sidelining of leaders and said that Mamata has betrayed the party ideals. He said that a ""deep rot and malaise"" has set in the party, and asserted that ""individuals in charge of the party currently are treating it as their personal fiefdom."" In an apparent dig at Prashant Kishor, who is the political strategist of TMC for 2021 polls, said that those who have no idea about the sacrifices of the party are being hired to assist the party. Days after Suvendu Adhikari joined BJP, Mamata Banerjee's Bengal government has taken action against his brother Soumendu Adhikari and removed him from a key post. On Tuesday, Mamata government issued a notice stating that Siddhartha Maity has been appointed as Chairperson of Contai Municipality, thus removing Soumendu Adhikari from the post. The decision was taken by Urban Development & Municipal Affairs ministry led by Firhad Hakim, who is a close aide of CM Mamata. So far, there are no reports of talks between BJP and Suvendu's family - his other brother and his father  - who are still MPs of Trinamool Congress.

Singh lashed out at Mukul Roy for returning to the TMC. ""Mukul Roy was never a public leader. In West Bengal, politics cannot be done from an AC room. His time in politics is up. Nobody trusts him. Everybody had information that he provided internal information about the BJP to TMC. If rivals get to know about your planning, it causes you loss,"" said Arjun Singh. However, losing his constituency of Domjur put Rajib Banerjee in a tough spot. Das' absence from the 'Bongaon Organisational District Committee' chaired by BJP leader Dilip Ghosh has sparked speculation about his possible return to the TMC. A few days ago, Khan's decision to quit a local BJP WhatsApp group had resulted in speculation. However, Saumitra Khan later rejoined the group. A former legislator from Uttarpara constituency, Prabir Ghoshal contested the recent assembly polls on a BJP ticket. He can now be seen openly praising TMC leaders. Biswajit Das quit the TMC to join the BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He was given a ticket to contest the assembly polls from Bagda constituency. Banerjee took to Facebook last week to criticise the BJP and even skipped a key meeting of the party chaired by West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh. She was handed a BJP ticket from Madhyamgram; 15.Saikat Panja, former TMC MLA from Monteswar; 16.Biswajit Kundu, former TMC MLA from Kalna. He is allegedly involved in the TET corruption case; 17.Shahin Akhtar, expelled TMC leader, he has been given ticket by the BJP from Chopra; 18. Rabindranath Bhattacharya, former TMC MLA from Singur. He was denied a TMC ticket this time around from the area owing to alleged reports of anti-incumbency against him. He was, however, given a ticket from the BJP to contest from the same Singur constituency; 19. Ghulam Sarwar, TMC leader and brother of TMC Minister, has been given BJP ticket from Goalpokhar; 20. Satyendranath Roy, former TMC MLA from Gangarampur, given BJP ticket from same constituency; 21. Krishna Kumar Kalyani, former TMC District President from Uttar Dinajpur; 22. Gauri Shankar Dutta, former TMC MLA but was denied ticket by TMC this time; 23. Dipak Haldar, former TMC MLA; 24. Prabir Ghoshal, former TMC MLA from Uttarpara; 25. Suvendu Adhikari. Former TMC MLA and Minister in Mamata Banerjee government; 26. Mihir Goswami, former TMC MLA; 27. Rathin Chakraborty, TMC Mayor from Shibpur, he has been handed with a BJP ticket from Shibpur Vidhan Sabha constituency; 28. Parthasarathy Chattopadhyay, former TMC MLA, given a BJP ticket from Ranaghat uttar Paschim constituency; 29. Debobrata Biswas, former TMC leader, given BJP ticket from Saptagram, just after a week of joining the party; 30. Gourchandra Mondal, former TMC Sabhadhipati of Malda, given BJP ticket from Manikchak; 31. Goutam Roy, former senior TMC leader from Kandhi, given BJP ticket from Kandhi constituency; and 32. Hiran Chatterjee, actor and former TMC youth wing general secretary. Soon after the names of the candidates were announced by the BJP on Thursday, a major outburst by BJP workers were witnessed across many districts in Bengal. Jalpaiguri, parts of Dinhata, Coochbehar, Ranaghat, Uttar Dinajpur, Dum Dum, Malda, Durgapur, Pandaveswar, Raniganj, among others, witnessed major protests by BJP workers. At many places, BJP workers ransacked their own party offices, locked down their district leaders, burnt effigies of their leaders, tore down posters and many have pledged not to work for the party any more. The leader also added that the BJP leadership has become totally insensitive about this. He also alleged that the BJP has become the new TMC now, with all the corrupt and thrown away leaders, while the TMC is now a fresh party. If this is how they want to win elections, so be it. “Why would a BJP worker accept someone as Jitendra Tiwari or Arindam Chowdhury as their candidate? They are the same people who had just months ago beaten up BJP workers and even got BJP workers killed. Some candidates who got rejected by the TMC this time due to massive anti-incumbency against them have also been given tickets by BJP. What is going on? Who has decided these names? The meetings they held with district leaders seem to hold no value. There are district leaders who are saying that they have never even heard of the name of the candidates who are nominated by the party from their area,” a senior BJP leader from Bengal told this correspondent. Bengal BJP’s Chief Spokesperson told The Sunday Guardian, “Giving tickets to TMC defectors and members from the other party who have joined the BJP is a part of BJP’s strategy to win West Bengal. In Bengal, people don’t vote for the individual, but for the symbol and our primary concern is to defeat the TMC in Bengal and for that, we need to weaken the opposition and that is a part of our strategy. Moreover, these candidates have also the winability factor attached to them. Tickets are given after due deliberations.” Moreover, Mondal predicted that Adhikari will lose even his security deposit in a direct faceoff with her. According to her, the former Nandigram legislator's refusal to accept this challenge will imply that he is scared of her. After joining TMC on Monday, Mondal revealed that she felt humiliated in BJP and added that she could never accept Adhikari as her leader. Subsequently, Saumitra Khan expressed his dismay at his wife's decision, severed all relations with her and sent her a divorce notion. While Adhikari resigned from the West Bengal Cabinet on November 27, he submitted a letter resigning as the MLA on December 16. Adhikari and a number of other MLAs and political functionaries joined BJP in presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah at a rally in Midnapore on December 19. On Monday, West Bengal Speaker Biman Banerjee accepted his resignation after he personally deposed before him.

He added that last week the agriculture department wrote to Beed Superintendent of Police Raja Ramaswamy to arrest officials who were absconding and the contractors involved. “Police have assured us action against the accused. We are waiting…,” Jadhav said. Munde said he was fighting the case before the Lokayutka. “The Lokayukta has ordered that FIRs should be filed against 29 labour societies and contractors,” he said. Joint Director of Agriculture D L Jadhav told The Indian Express that a departmental probe had been initiated against 24 government officials who have also been booked in the FIR. “So far, four have surrendered. Some are absconding, while some have secured anticipatory bail,” he said. “Those involved had approached the High Court and even Supreme Court, which rejected anticipatory bails,” said Munde, adding that he had held fasts and staged protests to get the FIRs lodged. Local Congress leader Vasant Munde, who first lodged a complaint with the state government and is now fighting the case before the Lokayukta, said on Thursday that in the first phase, the fraud related to 883 works till 2017. “Over 500 more works were undertaken in 2018. We had demanded an inspection of all 1,169 works. The inspection in the second phase of the works is underway,” he said. In the Parli case, the alleged fraud came to light in 2017, and after an internal probe, the agri assistants, agriculture supervisor, circle agriculture officers, taluka agriculture officers and sub-divisional officials were suspended by the agriculture department. The suspended officials were to reportedly inspect water conservation works. “I have been repeatedly saying it is a multicrore fraud. The amount of money involved is much more…,” he further alleged. Ramaswamy said, “I have not seen the letter so far… but we will certainly initiate action against the accused.” “The case is dragging as big political leaders from different parties are involved. Attempts are being made to protect them,” he alleged. Officials said the alleged irregularities took place at 10 or 12 villages of Parli taluka in Beed district, in which bogus bills were submitted to claim the full amount for incomplete works. They added that a probe by a vigilance squad appointed by the state agriculture commissioner showed that out of 883 works sanctioned, worth Rs 34 crore for three years (2015-17), there were irregularities in 307. The irregularities relate to claiming full amount for 50 per cent or 30 per cent work done, officials said."

MATTERS ARE FAR FROM ‘NORMAL’There is public concern, and even anger in many, at the fact that Wang Yi was permitted to come to India and hold meetings with NSA Ajit Doval and EAM S. Jaishankar. Both are known to be very close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and such feelings are getting diverted to him. The view from South Block is that such opposition to hosting him and giving him the opportunity to meet two of the team closest to PM Modi is different. It is that the visit provided an opportunity to demonstrate to Wang that matters are far from “normal” and that the Rs 103 billion dollar trade surplus that China now has with India does not indicate that it is, or can be, “business as usual”. Once the PRC Foreign Minister decided to throw protocol and diplomatic practice to the winds by arriving in Delhi on what was technically a non-official visit, the choice within South Block, in the view of those long part of its power elite, was prevent or ignore his presence, an action that global chancelleries may interpret as petulance. In contrast to Wang Yi’s tours in western capitals, where his hosts compete with each other in efforts at kowtowing to the VIP personage from the PRC, Prime Minister Modi declined to spare time from his schedule to meet the visitor from the PRC. Wang Yi is known to be a “hawk” on India, and has long been supportive of the many moves made by GHQ Rawalpindi in their unceasing quest to “melt down Hindustan”. Not only is Wang no friend of India, his itinerary prior to the landing of his aircraft in the technical area of Palam demonstrates the closeness of the regime he represents to forces that have long been a threat to international security. Given their reputation for politeness, EAM Jaishankar and NSA Doval, agreed to meet with the visitor. Both meetings were used by them to make clear to Foreign Minister Wang Yi that India expects the Chinese side to ensure a full return to the pre-2020 position across the Line of Actual Control. Attempts by this known foe of India to talk of “strengthening the Russia-India China triangle” and other such cosmetic issues would have been politely but firmly countered with a clear message. This was from PM Modi, and was that until China ensured a return to the pre-2020 position on the LAC and showed through action on the ground that it had changed course from foe to friend where India was concerned, the situation between India and China could never be “normal”. Doval and Jaishankar showed how successive Red Lines had been crossed by the PRC, especially during the period since Xi Jinping assumed control of the CCP. Civilities were shown to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in large part because of the fact that China despite its historical and atheistic rulers remains a great civilisation. It is similar to India in having a tradition that spans several millenia. More than anybody else, it is the Chinese people who are not being best served by the aggressive policies being pursued by the current leadership. Such policies are getting framed by Xi as a consequence of the inflammatory counsel of individuals such as State Councillor Wang Yi.The visiting Foreign Minister appears to have been in raptures at the joy of meeting soulmates such as the generals in Pakistan and the Taliban leadership. There is little doubt that Xi Jinping has lost the trust of the Indian people, as well as any confidence that he can be sincere in his overtures of friendship. After Team Xi’s dallying with NATO leaders, Vladimir Putin must have understood the fragility of the fulsome promises of limitless support given by Xi to him before the invasion of Ukraine. It is hardly known that Russia under Putin sought to join NATO and the EU multiple times, but after a while, understood that what that alliance sought was the permanent submission of the Russian Federation to the commands of the rest of Europe and their transatlantic partners. There are reports that the Wang Yi visit was because of “pressure from Putin”. In reality, the stopover in India was because of pressure from elements in the CCP that are alarmed at the way in which Xi has alienated India, and their fear that Team Xi may in future similarly cause a rupture in  relations with Moscow, especially now that it is under siege. So far as the US is concerned, it is only a matter of time before what may be termed the present friendly outreach policy of the Biden administration towards Xi Jinping gets replaced with a construct that is aligned not with PRC but with US interests. There was no more passionate admirer of Xi Jinping in early 2017 than President Donald J. Trump, as numerous statements and tweets of his at the time would indicate. Trump finally read the tea leaves correctly where the PRC was concerned, and so will President Biden. Meanwhile, rather than be “shaky” in the fashion described by him, India led by PM Modi has once again shown that the country knows the proper way to deal with those who are among the main planners of an expansionist leadership in Beijing that is out to replace the now faded hegemony of the US with that of its own. The brief but significant Wang Yi visit to India this week will enter the annals of diplomatic practice as a case study in how to handle dignitaries with aspirations to global hegemony in a polite but clearly disapproving manner. Referring to U.S. and European sanctions on Russia, Mr. Lavrov said he had briefed Mr. Jaishankar on “military operations” in Ukraine.  “We discussed the situation that has developed around the attempts of the Western colleagues, under the pretext of Ukrainian events, to strengthen their dominant role in world affairs and prevent the democratisation of international relations,” Mr. Lavrov said, adding that Russia appreciated India-Russia cooperation at the United Nations, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, BRICS and the G-20. “No one should kid themselves – Russia is going to be the junior partner in this relationship with China,” Singh said. “And the more leverage that China gains over Russia, the less favourable that is for India. I don’t think anyone would believe that if China once again breached the Line of Actual Control, Russia would come running in India’s defence.” Wang also addressed China’s stance on the Quad grouping, which includes India, US, Japan and Australia. The bloc intends to offer partner countries an opportunity to counter China’s rising commercial presence in the Asia-Pacific region. A leader in Beijing said once that if China and India cannot achieve sound development, then an Asian Century cannot be achieved, Wang told reporters at a briefing. “China and India are two ancient civilisations, two emerging economies and two big neighbours,” he added."

When first beached, INS Viraat was around 3,000 ft from the shore. Since then, on high tides, it has been dragged closer, using diesel-powered winches. The next high tide is on Sunday. The breaking down of the vessel will begin when high tide enables it to winched to the shore. This is expected to happen in the next couple of weeks, officials said. “INS Viraat, which had served the country for several years and was retired in 2017, has reached its final destination,” said the minister about the aircraft carrier which was brought from mid-sea and beached 3,000 feet away from the coast. The tug which pulled Viraat from Mumbai was used to beach it on Monday. Over the next one month, the ship will be slowly brought closer to the beach using diesel-powered winches during high tide. Officials said once the vessel reaches the shore sometime next month, the breaking will begin, officials said. During high tide, the sea-facing wrenches which are connected with iron ropes fastened to the aircraft carrier will be switched on. These wrenches will slowly drag the warship to the empty space on the beach marked out between an aging half-broken oil rig and a container ship. The INS Viraat lies 3000 feet away from the Alang shore, marked by the thick blanket of oil covering the sand caused by years of vessels gliding over to be broken. During high tide on September 28, the “dead vessel” was brought near the shore using a tug as the aircraft carrier had no power of it’s own. Usually, when a vessel is beached at Alang, it uses the force of high tide as well as its own engine power to glide on to the shore at speeds ranging between 15-20 knots. Viraat came at a speed of 2-3 knots and ran aground 3000 feet away from shore. It has been secured by iron ropes that are tied to diesel-powered wrenches. This ensures that the vessel does not tilt or change its position during tides and ebbs. “Dragging the ship 3000 feet inland will take more than a month as it can be done only during high tides. The soil underneath also plays a part. If it’s muddy, it is easier to winch and if it’s rocky, it will be difficult. Secondly, being a naval vessel, it has a smaller base and so it is more difficult to pull to the shore when compared to a wide-base oil tanker,” said Mukesh Patel, chairman of Shree Ram Group of companies which will break INS Viraat. Meanwhile China is focusing on enlarging its already significant submarine fleet. The Quad navies are regularly exercising and operating in the Indo-Pacific region. The carriers, though powerful, are costly to acquire and maintain. They also require a large number of ships and submarines to protect the flotilla.

He said India is making next-generation infrastructure such as metro networks, water-ways and more. ""In addition to convenience and efficiency , they will also contribute to a cleaner environment. We will meet our goal of 175 Giga Watts of renewable energy well before the target of 2022. Now, we are taking a big step ahead by seeking to achieve 450 Giga Watts by 2030,"" Modi added. The entire world can progress faster if there is greater support of technology and finance to the developing world, Modi said. Addressing the G20 side event on ""Safeguarding the Planet"", PM Modi said India is not only meeting its Paris Agreement targets, but also exceeding them. The entire world can progress faster if there is greater support of technology and finance to the developing world, PM Modi said. India is not only on track to achieve its Paris Agreement targets, but to exceed them beyond expectations, the prime minister said. ""To all my fellow residents of this planet, I make a solemn pledge today. Centennial India will not only meet its own targets, but will also exceed your expectations,"" Modi said. ""Today, as we are looking to set our sights even higher, we must also not lose sight of the past. We must not only revise our ambitions, but also review our achievements against targets already set,"" he said. India is not only on track to achieve its Paris Agreement targets, but to exceed them beyond expectations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said during the Climate Ambition Summit 2020 on Saturday, highlighting that the country has reduced its emission intensity by 21 per cent over 2005 levels. If we consider hydroelectricity as part of renewables — as it is considered globally — then we will need to increase new renewable capacity to 630 GW. This is definitely achievable. India is reaching this goal and most importantly, it will do so without adding to the cumulative emissions in the atmosphere. This is where the entire world should commit to go in 2030. ""We will not just achieve these targets, but even exceed them. Amongst G20 countries, India has progressed well on its targets. In the last five years, our renewable power capacity has increased by 162 per cent,"" he said. “For 50 per cent generation from non-fossil sources then, the installed capacity must rise to approximately 65-70 per cent. This is because India will need to increase energy consumption, but this growth should be from non-fossil and renewable sources. This is ambitious and will be expensive and this is why we need to make this conditional to international finance. This is what the world needs now in our climate risked time,” Narain said. He added that the initiatives of the LiFE movement should spread throughout the world. “I am immensely encouraged by the commitment that India has made to pursue environmentally sound policies and its pledge to significantly increase investment in renewable energy, championing International Solar Alliance. We need to unleash the renewable revolution and I look forward to working with India in driving this agenda forward."""

During a public event with visiting UK foreign secretary Liz Truss, Jaishankar complained about a “campaign” against India. In the joint statement issued after the meeting, India and the US have asked Pakistan to take “immediate, sustained, and irreversible action” to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks and called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and Pathankot attack to be brought to justice. Observing that China is seeking to refashion the region and the international system more broadly in ways that serve its interests, Austin said the two countries had identified new opportunities to extend their militaries’ operational reach and coordinate more closely together across the expanse of the Indo-Pacific. Meanwhile, Blinken, in his opening remarks, made an unexpected reference to India’s human rights records. The ministers committed to the continued exchange of information about sanctions and designations against terror groups and individuals, countering violent radicalism, use of the internet for terrorist purposes, and cross-border movement of terrorists. India and the US strongly condemned any use of terrorist proxies and cross-border terrorism in all its forms. They called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks to be brought to justice. ""The United States and India are going to continue our close consultation on how to manage the destabilizing effects of this Russian war."" When asked if President Biden demanded ""explicit commitments"" from India about not purchasing oil from Russia, US official replied: ""India, of course, is facing a very tense situation along the Line of Actual Control.  And when India sees the tight links between China and Russia, that’s obviously going to impact their thinking."" US Secy of Defence Lloyd James Austin III at India-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue said that he is looking forward to discussing a range of bilateral defense priorities with India, including deeper info sharing and industrial cooperation. ""That will help to ensure that our militaries are ready to meet any challenge,"" said the US Defense Secretary. Now, more than ever, democracies must stand together to defend values that we share. We all understand the challenges that we face in Indo-Pacific. China is seeking to refashion the region&int'l system more broadly in ways that serve its authoritarian interest: US Secy of Defence pic.twitter.com/XgcZ53CeZI ""India is going to make its own judgments"" when it comes to taking a stance in the Russia Ukraine war, a White House official said, responding to a question about whether US President Joe Biden pushed PM Modi on ""taking sides"" in the ongoing conflict. When asked that India has been among the nations that had been more reticent to speak out against the war in Ukraine, and the measures Biden took to make India condemn Russia and ""choose sides,"" the Biden administration official said that India's neutral position is subject to its own foreign policy. Pentagon on Monday hailed India-US defense ties and bilateral cooperation as it stressed: “We are having strong defense partnership with India, and we are working on making it stronger.” It added that with respect to the recent Russian oil imports, India like other countries can make its own decisions. However, the Pentagon stressed that it will continue to hold discussions about how to mitigate the destabilizing impacts of Putin's war and the atrocities in Ukraine. ""We instantly condemned the killings and have called for an independent inquiry. We hope that the ongoing discussions between Russia and Ukraine will lead to peace,"" PM Modi said. ""India has concerns about the links between Russia and China,"" Washington explained after the 2+2 Defense Ministerial meeting between the two countries to the American press. In response to why India does not choose to opt for a harsh tone against Russia, US officials emphasized New Delhi's diplomatic approach to ensure regional security. India and the United States will be discussing contemporary developments, including Ukraine, Afghanistan, the Gulf, and the Indian subcontinent. ""I thank Secy Blinken and Secy Austin for receiving us today and look forward to our talks,"" said EAM Dr. S Jaishankar at India-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue. ""Prime Minister Modi brought up the situation, again, in his public remarks, and there was discussion.  I mean, the President shared his views, and Prime Minister Modi shared his views,"" the official said, referring to Prime Minister's remarks where he condemned the Bucha killings and war atrocities on civilians in Ukraine. In what has been his former home turf as a diplomat — as India’s Ambassador to Washington — he surely found some time to think on how to revitalise this partnership. When asked by NewsMobile about the issue of a belligerent China posing a threat to democracies like the US and India and how should they handle China and further cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, he said: “We all have vital stakes today that the larger Indo-Pacific region is secure, I believe it is shared objective between India and the US to see the betterment of the region.” It was apparent, the Minister, who has also served as India’s envoy to China, wasn’t willing to cross the line of diplomatese on China, despite Beijing’s repeated provocation and acts of belligerence with India and the countries of the Indo-Pacific. The visit was also about finding solutions to issues that impact people, with a huge visa backlog for Indians in US missions in India. Speaking to Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Jaishankar even suggested that the Indian government can help the US government find a solution. Jaishankar flagged concerns and challenges that Indians have been facing in receiving visas to work and live in the US. In the next few months, New Delhi must ensure to build on this and keep a diplomatic continuity and pave way for a US Presidential visit in 2023. This is a treasured relationship, which needs to be nurtured by hands who know the lay of the land well. “That’s the sort of broad sense that I want to give you of a very solid, positive, productive bilateral conversation but framed in the context of larger global challenges where there was a very high degree of convergence on how we look at those challenges, we may articulate it a bit differently and our priorities at some times will be different,” Jaishankar said. “I think our relationship today impacts the rest of the world. There are a lot of countries which look to us individually and bilaterally for some part of the betterment which they hope for solutions, which the world is searching for in many respects,” Jaishankar said during the press briefing. The discussions in Washington also focussed on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Biden administration did praise India’s advice to Russia that now is not the time of war, a message sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I feel this is an issue where obviously it’s mainly for the US, but we will be supportive and collaborative,” Jaishankar said responding to a question about people facing visa issues. On the multilateral front, India and the US talked about the UN Security Council reform — an agenda that is dear to India and the Americans, according to Jaishankar, have offered their most explicit and specific backing so far with Biden mentioning it in his UN General Assembly address. They talked about continued cooperation at the UN, where, remember it is the US and India that together proposed the listing of Pakistan-based terrorists in the sanctions committee, a move that China has consistently blocked. When HT asked Jaishankar whether the two countries discussed Bangladesh and Myanmar — they discussed the latter in more detail than the former, given the deeper political and security challenges in Myanmar — the minister provided a deeper analysis of these conversations. ""With multiple interlocutors, there is a broader understanding today that in the subcontinent, it is to our mutual benefit if we coordinate policies effectively. It is a region where we put in a lot of resources, energies. It is closer to us, so we have an understanding of the place. And that is appreciated."" The two sides talked about China — there is little doubt that it would have come up in conversations with national security advisor Jake Sullivan, Blinken, defence secretary Lloyd Austin, and leaders of the intelligence community Jaishankar met. But there was a difference in the public emphasis on the issue. This doesn't mean that there aren't differences. Americans and Europeans are invested in punishing and defeating Russian and how the war ends, on what terms, matters to them; India is invested in the consequences of the war and the end of the conflict, as distant as it may be at the moment, is arguably more important for India than the actual terms on which it ends. More specifically, the US and Europe are toying with the idea of price caps on Russian oil; India has made it clear that energy security, both in terms of availability and cost, is its number one priority and has shown little interest in participating in mechanisms designed in the West to isolate Russia. It is also instructive that in their conversations, the two sides exchange views on how the situation is evolving, the course of the war, the facts on the ground as they see it rather than engage in a slanging match about who should be doing what about it. The most upfront about the China challenge was Austin, who, like in April during the 2+2 meet, explicitly mentioned China when he hosted Jaishankar at Pentagon.

India has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it has been maintaining that the crisis must be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue.Since the Ukraine conflict began in February, Prime Minister Modi spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a number of times. ""I met Indian External Affairs Minister @DrSJaishankar on the margins of the @ASEAN summit today in Phnom Penh to discuss ongoing efforts to expand our partnership & mitigate the effects of Russia's war on Ukraine. The U.S. supports India's #G20 Presidency,"" Blinken tweeted. ""A good meeting with US Secretary of State @SecBlinken. Discussed Ukraine, Indo-Pacific, energy, G20 and bilateral relations,"" Jaishankar said in a tweet, indicating the topics he discussed with Blinken. Jaishankar is accompanying Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, who is leading the Indian delegation to the ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit and the 17th East Asia Summit here. ""Met Canadian colleagues Trade Minister @mary_ng and FM @melaniejoly at the ASEAN gala dinner. All for greater trade and strategic convergence, while countering terrorism and opposing radicalization,"" he said in another tweet. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken here on Sunday and discussed bilateral ties, the raging Ukraine conflict, energy issues, G20 and the situation in the Indo-Pacific, days ahead of a possible meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden. Sullivan said that President Biden was looking forward to seeing Prime Minister Modi on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Bali. It is this discrepancy in worldview that is hurting this relationship at the present moment. And that is why Jaishankar has gone to the US, in the hope that his honest conversations with Blinken, Austin and some Congressmen and women will heal the divide. Also read: India has interests on both sides of US-China divide. Cold War holds clues for path ahead As to the Democratic Party’s concerns about curbs on individual freedoms in India, it is more than unlikely that Blinken or US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will directly engage Jaishankar on that front. If they do, it would be a remarkable interference in India’s internal affairs and the US knows that it could lead to a further frostiness in the relationship. Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen and heard publicly chastising Russian President Vladimir Putin for choosing war over peace in Ukraine on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Samarkand last week, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is travelling to the US where he is scheduled to meet his American counterpart Antony Blinken and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. He will also participate in meetings of the Quad, BRICS and the UN. In its stead, a growing suspicion rules. The Modi government is increasingly of the view that the Biden administration is being distracted from its main job, which is to expand and deepen the US’ relationship with India, by the exclusive pursuit of religious freedoms and human rights by do-gooders in Washington DC. There are several themes that Jaishankar can spin. First, Russia. The fact that PM Modi spoke clearly with Putin and told him that it was unfortunate he was choosing war over peace with Ukraine, or the fact that his comments in Hindi were put out on all social media, is a signal that India is not completely on Putin’s side of the fence."

His works assimilated the diverse experiences of Malayali life. In his passing, Kerala has lost one of its literary masters. pic.twitter.com/pOaEVC7h4L Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled Khader’s death, terming it as an irreplaceable loss for Malayalam literature and especially the progressive literature front. Well-known writer UA Khader, whose novels and stories over the last five decades in Malayalam are considered among the finest published works in the language, passed away at a private hospital in Kozhikode at the age of 85. He had been suffering from respiratory ailments for a long time. Khader won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1983 and the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award in 2009 for his most acclaimed work ‘Thrikkottur Peruma’. Some of his other works are Raziya Sultana, Arabikadalinte Theeram, Chempavizham, Arippravinte Premam and Srishtavinte Khajana. Khader, whose father was Malayali and mother of Burmese origin, was born near Rangoon (now Yangon) in present-day Myanmar. During the Second World War, he and his family fled Myanmar and came to Kerala where he had his school and college education. It was believed to be his companionship with prominent IUML leader CH Muhammad Koya, who went on to become the state’s chief minister, that led Khader into the world of books and writing. Eminent aerospace scientist Roddam Narasimha passed away at a private hospital in Bengaluru, an official said on the night of Monday, 14 December. He was 87. ""Narasimha was the DST Year-of-Science Chair professor at JNCASR and was holding the Pratt & Whitney Chair in Science and Engineering at the University of Hyderabad,"" Jayachandra said. Narasimha was awarded the country's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in 2013 for his immense contribution to science and technology. Narasimha was a professor of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in the city from 1962 to 1999, and Director of the state-run National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) of the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (ICSIR) from 1984-1993. Vettathunadu is not only the birthplace of Ezhuthachan but also that of Mahakavi Vallathol. A pioneer in every respectThough Ezhuthachan is hailed as the ‘Father of Malayalam literature’ even the historians don’t know much about his history. Some believe that his name was Ramanujan and others think that his name was Krishnan. It is believed that Ezhuthachan was born in Trikkandiyoor, which was part of the Vettathunadu Kingdom, in the fag end of the 15th century. Now you have to cross the main path and travel towards west to reach the birthplace of Ezhuthachan. After a while you will be greeted by a Kerala style monumental tower and this is the gateway to the hallowed Thunchan ‘smarakam’ (memorial). This is the memorial that had been put in place to keep the memories of the ‘Father of Malayalam literature’ alive. Many generations of Keralites might have passed through the historic maidan centuries ago. The ‘Pathinettara Kavikkal’ (18½ poets or scholars), who came from Zamorin’s Pattathanam, could have definitely visited the iconic Mananchira maidan. But no one knows whether Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, father of Malayalam literature, had ever visited the maidan in his lifetime. The Thunchan ‘smarakam’ was inaugurated by then Punjab Governor Pattom A Thanu Pillai on January 15, 1964. When one walks leisurely through the memorial building, you have an opportunity to look back at the illustrious life of Ezhuthachan whose contribution to Malayalam literature is sublime and rich. Certain places have a rich legacy and have a story or two to narrate to every generation. One such place is the Mananchira Maidan in the heart of Kozhikode city. When you step into the square, the rhythm of metrical verses and the beauty of the Malayalam language would flood your mind. Even now the 'maidan' resonates with the laughter and banter of Malayalam literary giants such as S K Pottekkatt, Uroob, N V Krishna Warrier, Thikkodiyen and U A Khader as they used to get together at the square in the evenings. Go live with Manorama Online App, the number one Malayalam News site on our mobiles and tablets. Though celebrated Malayalam poet Cherusseri had penned poems before Ezhuthachan, the former had weaved the verses in the ancient script of ‘Vattezhuthu,' which had 30 letters. It is believed that Ezhuthacahan had ushered in a 51-letter Malayalam script. It is also believed that it was Ezhuthachan who started the practice of writing ‘Om Namah Shivayah’ on sand as part of ‘Vidyarambam’ (initiation into the world of letters). Ezhuthachan travelled extensively to spread knowledge to new generations and it is supposed that he visited Chittoor in Palakkad. Lot of trees form a canopy in the open space and in between the trees one could find a pond, which was once used by the ‘Father of Malayalam language’. Very few cities in Kerala can perhaps boast the legacy of writers such as Vaikom Mohammed Basheer, Sanjayan, S.K. Pottekkatt, M.T. Vasudevan Nair, N.N. Kakkad, and U.A. Khader. Adding to this is the presence of literary publications such as the Mathrubhumi weekly, a vast network of libraries, and annual literary events such as Kerala Literature Festival."

There is a view within South Block that this time the Chinese will be tested on the sincerity of their commitment to the resolution of the crisis, especially after Indian troops occupied strategic heights along the LAC in the Chushul sector. Express interview with DG BRO on Atal Tunnel | ‘It was a question of prioritising… Plus the govt focus is to integrate all remote areas’ The international environment too is a challenge for the Chinese establishment. While the US administration under President Donald Trump, facing a deeply polarised election at home, has been hostile to the Communist Party of China (CCP), a network of strategic and like-minded countries — Japan, Australia, India and Europe (Germany just released its Indo-Pacific strategy) — are getting ready to counter the Chinese. At a time like this, New Delhi feels it will be difficult for Beijing to escalate the situation along the LAC. The day after Indian and Chinese Defence Ministers met in Moscow, the highest level in-person meeting between the two sides since the Ladakh standoff began early May, officials in New Delhi indicated they are watching whether General Wei Fenghe has the heft to influence the Beijing top brass on complete disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control. Officials said India can now negotiate from a position of strength since the Chinese have been reluctant to disengage from the Pangong north bank, Gogra Post and the Depsang Plains. Troops of the two armies are within firing range of each other in the Chushul sector where tanks and artillery have also been deployed. Read | Rajnath Singh arrives in Tehran, to discuss defence ties with Iran counterpart One factor that Indian strategic planners are banking on is the already stretched PLA. China’s eastern border is quite active because the Taiwan issue has been at the centrestage in the last few months, and the extent of the deployment that the Chinese can make on their south-western border is being watched in New Delhi. Indian officials say what has to be watched is the extent to which Wei can influence the top brass in Beijing. The Chinese Defence Minister is not as powerful as the Indian Defence Minister in the civilian-military leadership calculus. While all these factors are being pondered over before the next steps are taken, what has also emerged is the emergence of Russia as a neutral ground for Indian and Chinese leaders to engage each other. This has been evident since June when Russia emerged as a key diplomatic player amid the tensions between India and China. With both sides staring at the prospect of holding their positions through the harsh Ladakh winter, the Moscow meeting signals some sense of urgency to disengage. ""Now, we have a full-blown crisis on the LAC with China. The future is yet to unfold but we hope that mature diplomacy and decisive leadership will inform the government’s actions in protecting our territorial integrity,"" Gandhi said. Former prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh endorsed Gandhi's remarks and said that if the crisis on the border is not tackled firmly, it can lead to a ""serious situation."" The violent standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley of Ladakh region has thrown the spotlight on high-altitude warfare and the challenges that troops face, particularly when advantageous positions on the heights are occupied by the other side. High-altitude warfare is fought keeping the terrain and weather in mind. The kind of infrastructure and training that the troops require for high-altitude warfare are key factors. India must defend its territorial integrity and yes, it must do whatever it can to hit back at China, but, and this cannot be overemphasised, it is critical not to resort to knee-jerk reactions. Sun Tzu wrote: “Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing”. In the same way, India’s trade policy must be an informed choice, writes Udit Misra. ""This has caused severe distress to the veterans and serving soldiers alike. The India-China boundary dispute and management of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) are complex issues. My personal experience with the Chinese during the 2013 Depsang stand-off as General Officer Commanding of the Ladakh Division, has spurred me to bring some clarity to the whole debate and also to put to rest some very negative and vile comments in the media related to the entire issue,"" he writes. Read the full article here In his letter to the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh said: ""China is brazenly and illegally seeking to claim parts of Indian territory such as the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Tso Lake by committing multiple incursions between April 2020 till date. We cannot and will not be cowed down by threats and intimidation nor permit a compromise with our territorial integrity. The Prime Minister cannot allow them to use his words as a vindication of their position and must ensure that all organs of the Government work together to tackle this crisis and prevent it from escalating further."" At the Congress Working Committee, party chief Sonia Gandhi said that much of the border crisis can be attributed to the mismanagement by the Modi government and its policies. In a videoconferencing meet held today, Gandhi said that ""India has been hit by a terrible economic crisis, a pandemic of huge proportions and now by a full-blown crisis on the borders with China. Much of each crisis is attributable to the mismanagement of NDA Govt and wrong policies pursued by it."" This is a moment where we must stand together as a nation and be united in our response to this brazen threat: Press Statement by Former PM Dr. Manmohan Singh pic.twitter.com/qP3hN3Od9D At the Congress Working Committee meeting today, party president Sonia Gandhi blamed the “wrong policies” and mismanagement of Narendra Modi-led NDA government for much of the border crisis. Former prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh endorsed Gandhi’s remarks and said that if the crisis on the border is not tackled firmly, it can lead to a “serious situation.” Senior Congress leader Ashwani Kumar on Sunday said while the opposition cannot be faulted for asking the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “pertinent questions”, it is time for the nation now to show “unity of purpose” and present a “united face” against China. Arguing that the Indian diplomacy is now on test, Kumar said, “We must lend the moral support of the entire nation for them to leverage the goodwill enjoyed by India in the comity of nations.” He said the “Chinese aggression will be resisted by the full might of the Indian state” and asserted that India’s “response to Chinese brutality must factor the need to avenge the martyrdom of our brave soldiers who gave the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty”. The India-China standoff in Galwan Vallery last week has spurred anti-China sentiment among many Indians. Due to this many want the government to ban the sale of Chinese products in the country and also block apps that have Chinese origin. The Indian Institute of Human Brands (IIHB) conducted a ‘gun-shot’ telephonic survey over June 17 and June 18 to understand consumer sentiment on Chinese brands and Indian celebrities endorsing them and also the usage of China-based applications such as TikTok. IIHB asked a few quick-fire questions to 408 people on whether they will uninstall TikTok because it’s a Chinese app and according to the report 56 per cent know TikTok is a Chinese app. 32 per cent didn’t know about it. The report also stated that only 21 per cent said they will uninstall TikTok because it’s a Chinese app while 62 per cent are doubtful and said ‘maybe’, while 11 per cent said no. The impasse on the LAC will soon become a battle of survival on the Himalayan heights, where both sides are bedding in for winter. Withdrawal of troops and RSQA appear most unlikely without India accepting China’s 1959 claim line, which will be political hara-kiri for the Modi government. Equally, Xi cannot do in 2020 what he did in 2014 and 2017 – order the PLA to return to the barracks. If by some miracle a deal can be struck between Xi and Modi at the virtual meeting on the margins of the BRICS summit to be hosted by Moscow in mid November, it will at best be an uneasy truce. Modi’s articulation of the Indo-Pacific at the Shangrila Dialogue contradicted the idea of containment. As Jaishankar recently said during the release of his book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World, “strategic autonomy must not become strategic ambiguity”. India is trending that way. During this week’s second Quad ministerial conference in Tokyo, where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Chinese actions along LAC a gross aggression, Jaishankar was guarded and talked about “respect for territorial integrity, sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes”. India is not ready and willing to take the risk of making a choice yet. New Delhi worries endlessly about how Beijing will react as it believes a border settlement is achievable through dialogue and that could end India’s China challenge. The Chinese, on the other hand, have shown marked deftness in land-grab facilitated by sharp and smart military action, supported by an information war, psy war and influence peddling. China has achieved its political objective of securing the 1959 historic claim line. Still to be accomplished is converting the de facto into de jure and preserving  the military gains. The challenge for China is in maintaining its 1959 claim line as well as normal bilateral relations with India. Prudently, the government realised that given the power differential, the best course of action was dialogue, but only after blocking in strength the multiple intrusions, especially the one opposite Depsang in order to shield the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie airfield and garrison. The preemptive occupation of Kailash Range and Chushul heights has given India a bargaining chip. The government’s failure to provide a factual and official account of Chinese ingress has led to avoidable multiple stories about PLA military activities along the LAC, including the Galwan clash. A Chinese military source has finally admitted that its casualties at Galwan were five soldiers killed, including the commanding officer, which corresponds to the account in circulation immediately after the clash. If this is true, the disparity in casualties is astounding: 20 Indians killed including a CO, 76 wounded and 10 including three officers held in custody but later released. The Galwan memorial, a traditional tribute to martyrs, will not tell the true story but the Court of Enquiry will. The impasse on the LAC will soon become a battle of survival on the Himalayan heights, where both sides are bedding in for winter. Jaishankar has been exceptionally eloquent about choices India has to make in an uncertain world where disruptions are causing  agreements to be replaced with convergences. While Jaishankar is advocating taking risks and being more proactive, calling China a threat is marked with strategic hesitation. Over the last decade and more, India has leaned towards the US and its strategic vision of Indo-Pacific and its adjunct Quad – a clear concept of containing China regardless of the spin given to it. Unfortunately, by then India will not be able to withdraw its troops due to closure of passes. The best-case scenario looks something like this: Chinese PLA sitting pretty on a forcibly claimed LAC confronted by Indian forces. India will be seen sitting on the fence, unable to make strategic choices ironically due to its highly coveted strategic autonomy. This was a riposte to a Global Times bait that the Indian Army will not be able to withstand the harsh conditions in Ladakh. Persistence in denial on the situation along the LAC was best illustrated when Rajya Sabha chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu not once but twice requested Singh to brief a select group of parliamentarians, which was never done. Truth is, the Indian forces are currently deployed far behind the LAC India proclaimed in 1993 after the agreement on peace and tranquility between Prime Ministers Narasimha Rao and Li Peng.

China summoned the Japanese ambassador in Beijing to lodge stern representations over its participation in an ""erroneous"" Group of Seven (G7) nations statement on Taiwan, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday. Taiwan deployed missile systems to track Chinese air force activity near the median line and Taiwanese navy ships remained close to the median line to monitor Chinese navy activity, the person said. (Reuters) China is staging live-fire military drills in six self-declared zones surrounding Taiwan in response to a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island Beijing claims as its own territory. Just In: Indian statement on LAC violence.MEA spox: ""India and China have been discussing through military and diplomatic channels the de-escalation of the situation in the border area in Eastern Ladakh.""@IndianExpress The tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between Indian security forces and China’s PLA have renewed the question of how New Delhi should deal with a rising, assertive Beijing. C Raja Mohan, director of the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore and contributing editor on international affairs for The Indian Express, and Vijay Gokhale, Former Foreign Secretary and India’s Ambassador to China, look at Beijing's attempts to reorder the Indo-Pacific as its zone of influence. Security personnel in two districts of Himachal Pradesh bordering China have been put on alert following a violent face-off between China and India in Galwan valley of Ladakh. During his virtual meeting with Chief Ministers on Covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the sacrifices of soldiers along the border will not go in vain. This was his first reaction on the Army's violent faceoff with Chinese troops in the Galwan valley of Ladakh. ""India wants peace but is capable of giving a befitting reply, if instigated,"" PM Modi said. PTI Posing several hard questions to the BJP government, Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to tell the country how China was able to occupy Indian territory. In a video message, she said the Prime minister should disclose to the country the situation on the ground in the Galwan Valley. “The Prime Minister should come before the country and tell the nation the truth as to how China occupied Indian soil and why 20 Indian soldiers had to lay down their lives. What is the situation on the ground? Are our Army officers or soldiers still missing? How many of our Army officers and soldiers are seriously injured,” Gandhi asked. “What is the thinking, policy and solution of the Government to deal with the situation….We want to assure that the Congress party stands with the Army, soldiers and their families and the government in this hour of crisis. I am confident that in this challenging time the entire country will unite and face the enemy. I urge the Prime Minister to come before the nation at this time of crisis and reassure the country on the basis of truth and facts.” # Congress president Sonia Gandhi posed several hard questions to the BJP government and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to tell the country how China was able to occupy Indian territory. ""It is a matter of serious national concern as it has grave implications for national security,"" Congress senior spokesperson and party's deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said. ""As we have been requesting, the government should urgently take the nation into confidence. We demand that the government immediately convene a meeting and brief the leadership of political parties about the ground situation,"" he said. Between Doklam, a few years ago, and the current volatility at the LAC with China, it is important to understand these situations as part of a broader picture about global politics, the reality of China’s capacities and broad spectrum tactical options, and India’s own strategic goals and capabilities and options,"" Sarjan Shah writes BJP leaders, who have been asked to avoid commenting on China and making provocative remarks, now project the standoff as the result of a display of India’s assertive stance on its borders since Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 and the recent spurt in India’s attempts to build border infrastructure infuriating China. Clearly, much is being lost in translation even as Chinese adventurism breaches the understanding underlined in several meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. New Delhi should activate all political lines of communication with Beijing, including the ones between the special representatives to the border negotiations and the foreign ministers, to make this point and take it forward. Read The Indian Express editorial 'An inflection point' Jaishankar in his new book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World to be released on September 4, has sought realism on India’s China policy and said the border and future of ties with China cannot be separated. The book was written before the current stand-off on LAC but but he is banking on diplomacy to resolve the existing stalemate provided the Chinese are willing to cooperate by adhering to agreements and border protocols. Jaishankar will have to make amends for Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rhetoric in Parliament on Aksai Chin like Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh had to, in Beijing in 1999, when it came to his words on the China ‘threat’ following India’s nuclear tests. The Chinese attempt to intrude across LAC by stealth on the south bank of Pangong lake over the weekend was extremely provocative but was thwarted by the alertness of troops on heightened vigil following the PLA’s wholesale aggression in East Ladakh. For the time being, two months before winter sets in across the frozen desert, by accident  or design, both India and China are pursuing a common public policy on border tensions. China has denied its troops violated LAC and Brigade Commander-level talks were held to defuse tensions. Clearly the PLA will not abandon its efforts to encroach into Indian territory. Wish our troops had reacted in May in the way they have acted now! He is expected to meet Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow around September 10 for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Foreign Ministers conclave. Wang has been hyperactive in organising a south Asian QUAD – Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh – ostensibly on COVID-19 in India’s heartland and intermittently raised the ante on J&K in cahoots with Pakistan in New York but with little joy. These were far removed from single intrusions of the past with multiple ones stretching from Ladakh to Sikkim. The Army should have occupied Galwan heights and carried out counter intrusions on the Chinese side of LAC to secure equity for bargaining during negotiations. Jaishankar must persuade Wang into fulfilling commitments on restoring peace and tranquillity on the border. This should start an institutionalised dialogue process between the two for incremental progress, first in defusing and then defining the LAC, the former  preferably before winter sets in. For Jaishankar the challenge and genius lie in picking up the threads in India’s new map of J&K last year following which he said in Beijing that it does not materially change the border with China. To which Beijing retorted that status quo was unilaterally altered on map. Almost immediately after his statement, Minister for External Affairs, S. Jaishankar, chipped in to say that diplomacy could potentially resolve the border crisis provided China followed the rule book. Ukraine crisis: How confrontation between Putin’s Russia and Biden-led West will impact India’s foreign relations Thirdly, the new Cold War between the US and Russia and the sanctioned announced in the last few days are threatening free flow of goods and services, investments, banking, insurance and shipping on which China is heavily dependent for its prosperity. President Xi Jinping said at Davos meetings that he staked claims to the leadership of the globalisation process. If situation deteriorates in Ukraine, India’s defence deals with Russia will face more scrutiny: Harsh V Pant Why vested interests are hell-bent on dragging India into a distant conflict in Ukraine Ukraine crisis: Taking sides will harm India’s national interests Second, Russian military invasion comes at a wrong time for China even though both are said to have an understanding on the timing of such an invasion at the recently completed Beijing Winter Olympics. The communist party in China is scheduled to hold its 20th congress late this year and political factional struggles are intensifying. Russia, which helped form the communist party in 1921, has a lot of political leverage in China and the Ukrainian developments are expected to play out in the domestic political struggles. Already several factional leaders in China are questioning the Russian actions. Despite the clampdown on any negative coverage of Russia in China’s media, political dissonance in China is rising. Ukraine crisis sinks Indian markets, set to hit bilateral trade with Kyiv The continuing Russian invasion of Ukraine and bombing of several cities have provided a strategic opportunity for China, but also several challenges to its foreign and security challenges — typically representing the meaning for its word weiji. However, challenges galore for Beijing. To wade off Western unilateral policies and regime change, China and Russia have for the past two decades pushed through a multipolarity debate and criticised the US actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ironically, Russian actions in Ukraine — defended by China’s foreign minister Wang Yi as “legitimate security concerns” threaten to upset the apple cart and take the sting away from any future western actions on China. However, in the last decade, China’s assertiveness in the neighbourhood and beyond has led the US to configure Beijing as a “pacing challenge” as the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Ashton stated. Russian invasion now tends to bring back the US-Russia confrontation to the forefront in the Trans-Atlantic region, providing China once again a strategic opportunity to expand its power in the Indo-Pacific. China’s adventurism in the region now knows no bounds, except for the resistance posed by regional powers like Japan, Australia, Vietnam, India and others. Lt General D.B. Shekatkar, who chaired a 2016 defence ministry committee on military reforms, sees the Chinese incursion as a ploy to throw the Indian army off balance and to increase the buffer zone between India and Aksai Chin. “They want to test our resolve and see how we react when they intrude into such a sensitive region,” he says. The Chinese, he feels, would like to increase their influence towards the Karakoram Pass, particularly areas like Daulat Beg Oldie, where we have built roads and a landing strip has come up to prevent an Indian military thrust towards Xinjiang or Tibet. A few years back, the top brass of the Indian Army’s Northern Command decided to put a twist to a war game. The Udhampur-based command, which defends a 2,000-km-long horseshoe-like territory from the plains of Jammu to the rugged deserts near the border of Uttarakhand, was examining the possibility of war with Pakistan. That year, they decided to throw China into the mix, what if the command had to simultaneously battle two countries? The war game was played out, saw China going on the offensive in the first two days with Pakistan joining in. The conclusions, as one planner put it mildly, were worrying. The army, even with the support of the air force, would find the going extremely tough. In an off-the-record media interaction a few years ago, a senior member of the present security establishment dismissed a two-front war scenario as “improbable” because it did not factor in India’s not insignificant diplomatic heft. Regardless of the outcome, the army will continue to be reminded of its vulnerabilities in the only theatre where it faces both its adversaries. The Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, where the Chinese soldiers are currently encamped, is barely 100 kilometres as the crow flies from the watchtower-like Saltoro Ridge overlooking the Siachen Glacier where Indian troops observe Pakistani positions. The PLA troops were part of an annual military exercise on the Tibetan plateau, who were then diverted to carry out the intrusions across the LAC when the war games ended. The plan, Indian military analysts feel, might have been at least three months in the making. “These (the intrusions) were not a local commander’s decision,” says Lt Gen. S.L. Narasimhan (retired), mem­ber of the National Security Council Advisory Board and a keen China watcher. “They were coordinated at the (Chengdu-based) Western Theatre Command at the very least.” Government officials believe the Chinese probes are a direct fallout of the August 5 bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh into Union territories. Ladakh, particularly a triangular wedge of territory the Indian Army calls ‘Sub Sector North’, becomes crucial in this equation. It sits between Gilgit-Baltistan, occupied by Pakistan, and Aksai Chin, the arid easternmost fringe of Ladakh. Analysts say the Chinese incursions are part of a wider strategy of throwing India off balance in a territory whose geo-strategic importance is only set to increase as the government expands its air and road infrastructure, allowing its troops to patrol hitherto inaccessible frontier regions. The meeting will be held on the Chinese side of the border point, officials say, because the PLA had called for it. US president Donald Trump’s May 27 offer to mediate between the two countries, turned down by India, and a significant June 2 statement from secretary of state Mike Pompeo that ‘China had moved up its forces along the LAC’ also played a significant role in defusing the standoff. “Ladakh is a lakshman rekha for India,” warns P. Stobdan, India’s former ambassador to Kyrgyzstan. “We cannot afford to allow the Chinese in here. Once they come here, they are entering a water-rich area with three rivers, the Shyok, Galwan and Chang-Chenmo.” Defence minister Rajnath Singh said in a June 2 TV interview that the PLA had intruded in “sizeable numbers” but that talks were on to resolve the standoff. A restoration of the status quo is expected at a June 6 meeting between the lieutenant generals of both armies at the Indian border point of Chushul-Moldo in Ladakh. This is the first meeting of Corps Commanders from both sides. Army officials say nothing less than a PLA pullback to their pre-May 5 positions will do. Analysts like Stobdan believe the bifurcation has opened up a totally new geopolitical arena. India has changed the narrative on the LAC, and had forcefully reasserted its territorial claims. “As long as Ladakh was a part of J&K, China wasn’t a major factor. After the August 6 abrogation, the Chinese are saying that now that Ladakh is a separate entity, we have a stake here. They want to act before India starts internationalising Aksai Chin.” War games are not definitive, they often play out worst-case scenarios and illustrate cold hard ground realities for commanders who fight on the ground. One such reality is currently in play in what the government calls the “western sector”, the eastern shoulder of its newly created Union territory of Ladakh. The Indian army faces off against the Chinese PLA (People’s Liberation Army) which carried out one of its most determined incursions in decades in early May this year. The intrusions at three locations across India’s perception of the 800-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, are the biggest in recent years. The intruding troops encamped across the LAC could number over a thousand in all the locations with support troops, armour and artillery, in the rear behind the LAC. They are faced by an equal number of Indian troops as shown in mobile phone videos of the standoff (see pictures) at the Galwan River Valley and Pangong Tso which were widely circulated on social media. But it will also take a full-fledged war, nothing less, for the PLA to march across the Shyok river. Such a scenario appears far-fetched at the moment, say military planners. The PLA are playing a high-altitude version of their traditional board game, Wei Qi, encircling rather than finishing off opponents. “Our perception of the LAC is immaterial to them. The PLA is now sitting on their perception of the LAC. If we actually look at the Ngari prefecture map (easternmost part of Tibet), the game becomes clear,” says Lt General D.S. Hooda, former Northern Army commander."

We recognize the threat emanating from terrorism, extremism conducive to terrorism and radicalization. We are committed to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including the cross-border movement of terrorists, and terrorism financing networks and safe havens. We reiterate that terrorism should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group. We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to contribute further to the global efforts of preventing and countering the threat of terrorism on the basis of respect for international law, in particular the Charter of the United Nations, and human rights, emphasizing that States have the primary responsibility in combating terrorism with the United Nations continuing to play central and coordinating role in this area. We also stress the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach of the whole international community to effectively curb the terrorist activities, which pose a serious threat, including in the present-day pandemic environment. We reject double standards in countering terrorism and extremism conducive to terrorism. We call for an expeditious finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism within the UN framework and for launching multilateral negotiations on an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism, at the Conference of Disarmament. We welcome the outcomes of the Seventh BRICS Counter-Terrorism Working Group Plenary Meeting and its five Subgroup Meetings. We commend the Chair for hosting the Seminar on Targeted Financial Sanctions Related to Terrorism and Terrorist Financing, and look forward to organization of the Seminar on Strengthening Counter-Terrorism Capacity Building in Developing Countries, and the BRICS Police Training Program. We also look forward to further deepening counter-terrorism cooperation. 34. We look forward to further deepening counter-terrorism cooperation and reaffirm the sole authority of the UN Security Council for imposing sanctions and call for further consolidation and strengthening of the working methods of UN Security Council Sanctions Committees to ensure their effectiveness, responsiveness and transparency, while avoiding politicization of any of their proceedings including listing proposals objectively on evidence-based criteria. 30. We reaffirm our commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons and stress our strong commitment to nuclear disarmament and our support to the work on this subject during the session of 2022 of the Conference on Disarmament. We note the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the People’s Republic of China, the French Republic, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races on 3 January 2022, in particular the affirmation that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. 36. We are concerned about the serious drug situation in the world and reiterate our commitment to the existing international drug control mechanism underpinned by the three United Nations Drug Control Conventions and the various political commitments.

That is going to prove problematic for the G7 in contrast, whose new energy supply chain demands have effectively reversed nearly all commitments made at last year’s COP26, with coal power stations being put back into use and energy supplies now being shipped from ecologically problematic fracking sources in North America rather than being piped across from Russia.

Regarding the details of the newly set up commission and what issues were discussed, Yusuf said it encompassed matters ranging from transnational crime, drug trafficking, cooperation against terrorism and mutual capacity building in areas such as disaster management. Regarding the signed protocol, the press release said that it ""covered wide-ranging security related [to] matters of mutual interest and established [a] coordination mechanism between Pakistan's National Security Division and the Security Council of Uzbekistan"". The NSA said that Pakistan was criticised sometimes for being proactive in promoting engagement with Afghanistan. Explaining the rationale behind the stance, Yusuf said: ""It may be a luxury for the Western world sitting 10,000 miles away [to not bother about Afghanistan] but we do not have any option to disengage from Afghanistan."" Yusuf said Uzbekistan shared the same stance with Pakistan on the war-torn country and there was a long discussion on the issue in today's meeting. The NSA was also questioned about the comments of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority czar Khalid Mansoor who last month alleged that the United States was trying to derail the project. The Indian intervention by permanent representative T.S. Tirumurti zeroed in on this point. “It is essential that we don’t lose sight of the ease with which the proscribed Haqqani Network and its supporters, especially with support from Pakistani authorities, have worked along with prominent terrorist organisations like Al-Qaida, ISIL K, etc. in South Asia,” he stated. Tirumurti said that the UNSG’s report should cover Pakistan-based terror groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyabba and Jaish-e-Mohammad as they are proscribed as terrorist entities under the ISIL and Al-Qaeda sanctions regime. India argued that the SG's biannual report should include the actions of Pakistan-based terror groups. “The world is fully aware that these groups also perpetrate terrorist activities from safe havens in Pakistan, including through violent attacks in Afghanistan that have disrupted the peace process. We are also witnessing the relocation of terror groups to Afghanistan especially in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, across the Durand line. To not name them in this report is doing a disservice as it gives only a partial and a biased view of the situation in the region,” he stated. In recent months, there were more and more reports of terrorist fighters and their family members trying to raise funds through cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Further, terror fighters were apparently using the opportunity of the COVID-19 pandemic by selling personal protective equipment (PPE). “One State brought charges against a reported ISIL facilitator for operating a website purporting to sell N95 face masks.” New Delhi: The Islamic State’s terror activities were the cynosure of all eyes at the United Nations Security Council’s main discussion last week, after the Secretary General’s biannual report by UN, with India arguing that it should include the actions of Pakistan-based terror groups. The Indian read-out stated that Ministry of External Affairs officials briefed their Chinese counterparts on “India’s priorities during its UNSC tenure”. The Chinese foreign ministry noted that “Both sides exchanged views on safeguarding multilateralism, United Nations peacekeeping operations, counter-terrorism and other issues”. Vladimir Voronkov, Under‑Secretary-General for Counter-Terrorism and the head of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, had pointed out that the secretary-general had called for the voluntary repatriation and praised Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for repatriating hundreds of children from north-east Syria. The EU states were called out for being tardy. The Finance Minister has also announced introduction of CentralBank Digital Currency (CBDC) by the Reserve Bank of India(""RBI"") using blockchain starting2022-23. President Ghani, who spoke before Prime Minister Khan at the conference, had alleged that 10,000 militants sneaked into Afghanistan from Pakistan to create unrest there. He also said he had a conversation with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev about how all the neighbours in the region could facilitate the Afghan peace process. Fearing influx of Afghan refugees in Pakistan due to growing violence in the neighbouring country, the prime minister called upon the European Union (EU) and international community to support Pakistan in the rehabilitation of Afghan refugees. • Says Afghan turmoil to affect Pakistan the most• Seeks EU support for peace process• Tells Indian media RSS is hurdle in way of talks• Terms ties with Uzbekistan ‘beginning of prosperity’"

India is not responsible for the problem of climate change. Still we will do our bit. Presently, we are contributing only 6.8 per cent of global emissions and per capita emissions is only 1.9 tonnes. Thus, our historical as well present contribution to Green House Gas (GHG) emissions is low. ""She didn't harm a single human being even when she ran in searing pain in the streets of the village,"" he wrote. A First Information Report has been filed against unknown persons. No arrests have been made so far. Elephant killing in Kerala has nothing to do with Malappuram Muslims The fact is that the incident actually happened in Mannarkkad in Palakkad district of Kerala, and not in Malappurram. But there is a growing sense in the Indian climate establishment that India may not take any target at all. The precise legal status of the Paris Agreement’s various clauses needs re-examination in light of Boris Johnson's claim that Glasgow would result in legally “enforceable limits” on emissions, as well as O’Neill’s statement in Delhi that “There is nothing binding in the Paris Agreement”. While the Paris Agreement says that each target “will represent a progression” over the one that preceded it, even the most minor tweak may ensure compliance in letter. This is absolutely crucial, and cannot be over-emphasised. Together with mitigation and adaptation, loss and damage is the third pillar of the Paris Agreement. The progress made at Paris is a vague commitment by developed countries to help developing countries, but no funds have been committed, due to fears that this might imply an admission of legal liability, despite the Paris Agreement explicitly saying it does not. Given that neither The Guardian nor The Independent covered O’Neill’s only foreign engagement in Delhi, and most other coverage consists of her praise for India, this is clearly the smoking gun that reveals our small role (see The FT’s smoking gun). Markets are the key element of the Paris Rulebook that remains to be closed and the consequences of a hasty two-speed implementation cannot be determined. Like in other sectors, markets have shown that they can operate in rather perverse when it comes to carbon. More thought to an air-tight rulebook is prudent. Russia, another big emitter, has not yet confirmed if President Vladimir Putin will participate in the summit. With Moscow's ties with the West at a post-Cold War low, the U.S. summit has generated little buzz in Russia.

While climate change does not directly or inherently cause violent conflict, its interaction with other social, political and economic factors can, nonetheless, exacerbate drivers of conflict and fragility and have negative impacts on peace, stability and security, he said. Noting that even the best science available claims that climate change only exacerbates conflict and is not a reason for conflict and does not threaten peace and security, he said that in a number of fragile contexts, where governments are struggling to provide basic services due to capacity and legitimacy issues, instances of chronic emergency conditions and famine risks are largely driven by continued political violence disrupting harvests and aid supplies rather than by climate factors alone. Mr. Yogajayananda said there was no report of major wildlife death or dense forest being affected. Though the State government said the core area of the biosphere was untouched by the fire, environmentalists and local activists raised alarm over possible damage to flora and fauna. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who reviewed the situation, was informed that the fire was under control and no loss to wildlife and big trees had been reported. “Local people usually set sal leaves lying on ground on fire to collect Mahua and other non-timber forest produce. The heat-wave condition in Mayurbhanj aided the fire. Luckily, the core area of the Similipal National Park does not have any major fire,” said J. D. Pati, Deputy Director Similipal.

Responding to the police report, Mukul Roy told a press conference in Kolkata: “It is true that a bulletproof car was provided (to Nadda) by the state police. But we did not see policemen along the route. The handful of policemen we saw, stood as mute spectators as we were attacked. Had Naddaji not been inside a bulletproof car, anything could have happened to him. This is a lawless state. I think President’s Rule should be imposed immediately in Bengal.” Roy insisted that Rakesh Singh “did not do anything provocative”. In Kolkata, the West Bengal Police said in a report to the chief minister that the attack on Nadda’s convoy was the result of “provocation”, and that barring the “10-15 minutes” of trouble at Sirakol in South 24-Parganas district, the rest of the journey to Diamond Harbour from Kolkata was peaceful. WATCH | Stones hurled at vehicle of BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya in West Bengal pic.twitter.com/TORSzQwjUz Earlier in the day, a senior Home Ministry official had told The Indian Express that Governor Dhankhar had sent a report on the attack, “and how it transpired despite the chief secretary and DGP being alerted about security needs of the visit”. “While further reports are being obtained and compiled, in the circumstances, I am directed to request you to kindly dispense with the presence of the state officials in the meeting, considering that the state government is already addressing the issue with utmost seriousness,” he said. The Governor’s report had “painted a grim picture of the law and order situation in the state,” the official said. “To discuss these issues, the chief secretary and the DGP have been summoned.” According to sources in the state administration, Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay reiterated the state government’s stand on the matter. Earlier in the day, the Mamata Banerjee government moved the Supreme Court on Friday against the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) summons to the officers. The West Bengal government agreed to do so and assured the security lapses will be avoided in the future,” said a government official.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has alleged the attack on Nadda’s convoy was staged as BJP leaders always travel with their own security. Bandyopadhyay and Virendra had also been summoned to Delhi on December 14 after Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar submitted a report to the government on the law-and-order situation in the state. But they expressed their inability to travel to the national capital. This came a week after a row between the Centre and the state government following an attack on BJP president JP Nadda’s convoy near Kolkata.

Legislative scrutiny was completely bypassed,” Sharma said, adding that farmers are protesting in the “cold” and events like this show “utter insensitivity”. CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury described the event as a “colossal waste of resources”. “The head of Parliament is the President. He was not there. The Vice President, who is the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, was not there. None of the Opposition leaders were there. And, moreover, doing it at this time when people require a lot of resources for survival is a colossal waste of resources. There is no clarity on the vaccine, jobs are being lost and farmers are on the streets. Is this the priority at this time?” Yechury told The Indian Express. Among those who were invited but chose to skip the event were Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. While Chowdhury was in his constituency in West Bengal, Azad told The Indian Express that he could not attend because of concerns over the Covid spread. DMK Rajya Sabha MP T K S Elangovan, who was in Delhi but did not attend the event, said “this is not the right time for such an event”. Trinamool Congress Parliamentary party leader Derek O’Brien targeted the Prime Minister and criticised “another photo opportunity…while the real heroes of our country, farmers, are spending wintery nights in protest for their lives and livelihood”. “At this time, when the economy is gasping because of the pandemic, the timing reflects misplaced priorities. What we need is not a building or a structure…the spirit of Parliamentary democracy must be kept fully intact and not be violated. The institutions, their functioning and sanctity, should not be undermined,” Congress Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, told The Indian Express. Many Opposition leaders said there was a broad consensus on not attending the event although there was no specific decision or announcement. However, representatives of some non-BJP parties, including BJD, AIADMK and YSR Congress, attended the ceremony apart from NDA ally Chirag Paswan of LJP.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Mehta ensured that critical orders passed by High Courts were challenged and argued against before the Supreme Court. On the migrant crisis, Mehta’s aggressive stance in court that there was no migrant walking on the road, saved the day for the government. He was also the Centre’s troubleshooter in West Bengal for the post-poll political drama that played out in court. Reeling under Covid-19, Netflix and a government with an eye on everything from star deaths to star cruises, Bollywood has proved to be a purring cat in lion’s clothing.

While working, Nilekani avoids communication tools such as messages and WhatsApp. Modi’s critics thought that Covid and the rollback on farm laws had dented his image but there was almost no political cost. Abstaining on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and yet reaching out to European nations to evacuate 22,000 Indians out of a war zone is seen as a formidable diplomatic success under his leadership.

How will Munir’s appointment as army chief impact India-Pakistan relations? Anand Arni, former special secretary in India’s external intelligence agency, the Research & Analysis Wing, throws light on what Munir’s appointment means for Pakistan, India-Pakistan relations, and Pakistan’s ties with the United States and the Taliban regime. In a discussion with The Diplomat’s South Asia editor Sudha Ramachandran, Arni said that “if Khan crosses certain red lines, the military would act but if he stays within certain bounds, they will not do much.” Pakistan’s new Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir. Munir knows India in the sense that he not only headed the ISI and MI, both of which devote much time to India, but also he has commanded the Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA), under Bajwa who was then commander of the X Corps, and he was later appointed as Corps Commander Gujranwala. Both these military formations have an India focus. Months of rumor and speculation have ended for now, with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appointing Lt. Gen. Asim Munir as the country’s new chief of army staff (COAS). The change of guard in the Pakistan military has come at a difficult time for the country – Pakistan is in the grip of deep political polarization and instability as well as a severe economic crisis. Although appointing Munir to the top military post was a consensus decision, it is unlikely to have made former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan happy. As I said, it is the Army’s consensus that will hold and this consensus is hammered out by the Corps Commanders who meet collectively once a quarter or whenever there is a need. It was not that Bajwa propounded something of his own in the first place, it was what was probably proposed and approved. It was Bajwa’s to implement and there may be nuances here and there, which reflect Bajwa’s views. It is called the Bajwa doctrine because it was he who articulated it.

The people of the country will build the new Parliament together. The new Parliament building will exemplify the coexistence of the new and the old,” Modi said. Marking a milestone in India’s democracy and putting his own stamp on the Government’s showpiece Central Vista redevelopment project, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building on Thursday and said that it will fulfil the country’s aspirations of the 21st Century while symbolising the “coexistence of the new and the old”. On the occasion, messages from President Ram Nath Kovind and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu were read out. Kovind said the “new building will stand alongside the present Parliament House in harmony, joining our past with the future in a seamless manner”. Naidu said that “public representatives will find a congenial space to debate public issues in a collegial manner”. The Prime Minister also hit a personal note while detailing the need for a new Parliament. “The (existing) building is now looking to retire. It is incumbent upon all of us to give 21st Century India a new Parliament Building. And this is a step towards achieving that,” he said. “It is our responsibility to ensure that democracy, which is at the very heart of the Parliament’s existence, continues to evoke hope. We must keep in mind that every elected representative is answerable to the people and the Constitution. All our decisions should be guided by the principle of nation first and national interest,” Modi said. Modi said the new Parliament building draws its strength from the country’s robust democracy. “During Independence, doubts were raised on the future of the nation. Forecasts were made that democracy will not be successful in India, citing illiteracy, poverty, social diversity and lack of experience. Today, we can say with pride that we have proved the naysayers wrong and the 21st Century world is witnessing Indian democracy’s progress,” Modi said. Referring to the country’s history, which is “behind the success of the democratic project in India”, Modi spoke about the jansabhas in the 12th Century during the philosopher Basavanna’s time, which “precedes even the Magna Carta, a 13th Century document which is often considered the foundation of democracy”. Given this tradition, Modi said, it is “ironic” that there are attempts by the western world to explain democracy to India. “Usually, elsewhere, discussions on democracy mostly revolve around elections, governance. However in India, democracy forms the soul of the nation, it is a way of life, which evolved over centuries. When we will discuss our democratic history with pride, India will emerge as the mother of democracy,” he said. The building will be earthquake-resistant, and adaptable to the most modern digital technology. It will incorporate indigenous architecture from different parts of the country, and showcase cultural diversity. “I will never forget the day I entered Parliament for the first time, in 2014. This is the same building where our Constitution was drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar and our founding fathers. Every legislation drawn up in this building is our pride. But we need to accept the reality as well. This building is nearly 100 years old. There has been relentless repair work over the years to keep it up and running,” Modi said.

Normally there would be access to seeds or plant remains. But through the lipid residue analysis, we can confidently ascertain that consumption of beef, goat, sheep and pig was widespread, and especially of beef,’’ said Suryanarayan, 29. lead author of the study who completed her PhD in February and now works with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. It finds dominance of animal products such as meat of pigs, cattle, buffalo, sheep and goat, as well as dairy products, used in ancient ceramic vessels from rural and urban settlements of Indus Valley civilisation in northwest India – in present-day Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. “Out of domestic animals, cattle/buffalo are the most abundant, averaging between 50% and 60% of the animal bones found, with sheep/goat accounting for 10% animal remains. The high proportions of cattle bones may suggest a cultural preference for beef consumption across Indus populations, supplemented by consumption of mutton/lamb,’’ says the study. Suryanarayan told The Indian Express that while there have been many studies on the food habit in Indus Valley civilisation before, these papers primarily focused on crops grown then. Suryanarayan’s PhD was on “What’s cooking in the Indus Civilisation? Investigating Indus food through lipid residue analysis.’’ The study, titled “Lipid residues in pottery from the Indus Civilisation in northwest India” and led by Akshyeta Suryanarayan as a part of her PhD thesis at the University of Cambridge, looks at the food habit of the people of that era on the basis of lipid residue analysis found in pottery from Harappan sites in Haryana. Shinde said, “We knew that this was probably the case because of the masses of animal bones and remains found, which could not just be through natural causes. But the lipid residue analysis is hard scientific evidence of it.” Prof Shinde told The Indian Express: “There have been two other research papers looking at Indus Valley civilisation meals. The first, published in 2011-12, was by Dr Arunima Kashyap, who first established the presence of curry. She discovered consumption of brinjal, turmeric, garlic and ginger. Then, Dr Kalyan Shekhar Chakraborty established a couple of months ago, from lipid residue investigation from vessels in Gujarat, consumption of goat, sheep and the making of diary products like cheese and paneer, clarified butter and yoghurt. There is also evidence of hares and birds being eaten, although little evidence of chicken being a part of the diet, according to the study. “Ledge-shouldered jars and large storage jars at Harappa have been linked to storage of liquids such as wine and oil,’’ it says. By Gopi Maniar: A new study has revealed that the diet of people from the accident Indus Valley civilization was dominated by meat. The study published in Journal of Archaeological Science has shown that apart from cultivating and growing crops, the civilization also used to eat meat. In fact, experts assume that the tandoori roti and chicken may have first come from the Indus Valley civilization. The study has found that the diet was dominated by meat of animals like pigs, cattle, buffalo and goat. Dairy products were also used in the civilization which is lies in northwestern India and is currently part of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The research has been done on the basis of remains of food that were left from the civilization on mud utensils used by the ancient people. “This study is unique in that it has gotten to look at the contents of the vessels. Normally there would be access to seeds or plant remains. But through the lipid residue analysis, we can confidently ascertain that consumption of beef, goat, sheep and pig was widespread, and especially of beef.” The meat of animals such as buffalo, sheep, and goat, as well as dairy products were dominant in the diet of the people of Indus Valley, finds a new study published on Wednesday, 9 December, in the ‘Journal of Archaeological Science’. The study revealed that “high proportions of cattle bones may suggest a cultural preference for beef consumption.” The study analyses the food habits of the people of Indus Valley, based on the lipid residue found in pottery and ceramic vessels from the then Harappan sites in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Titled Lipid residues in pottery from the Indus Civilisation in northwest India, the study was led by Akshyeta Suryanarayan as a part of her PhD thesis at the University of Cambridge. The pattern is similar at the sites in northwest India, where domestic and wild mammals, and smaller proportions of birds, reptiles, riverine fish, and molluscs were consumed,"" the study added. Indus valley civilization or Harappan civilization is regarded as the earliest known human settlement where urban culture started to take shape. Now, a new study has shed some light on the type of food that these populations consumed. The surprising findings suggest that the ancient civilisation devoured largely on a meat-based diet. The evidence for the ancient South Asian civilisation’s affinity towards meat comes from the prehistoric ceramic cooking vessels extracted from several archaeological sites, which belonged to the rural and urban settlers of that time. For this, the researchers analysed lipids absorbed by the vessels to get insights into the archaeology of food. Lipids are the hydrocarbon molecules including fats, oils and certain vitamins and are known to be an important component of living cells. As per the study, lipid residues like fatty acids provide chemical evidence for the presence and use of items like milk, meat, and other products used during the Indus population. The study looked into ceramic vessels belonging to the Mature Harappan period (c.2600/2500–1900 BC). Dr Suryanarayan said: ""Our study of lipid residues in Indus pottery shows the dominance of animal products in vessels, such as the meat of non-ruminant animals like pigs, ruminant animals like cattle or buffalo and sheep or goat, as well as dairy products.” The research was conducted in the northwest parts of India—where the Indus valley flourished—which now forms part of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The study highlighted that the people in those times ate a variety of animal meat, including pigs, cattle, buffalo, sheep and goat, in addition to some dairy products. The findings also assert that despite a large number of remains of domestic animals excavated from the sites, there has been no direct evidence found on the use of dairy products in vessels. “The high proportions of cattle bones may suggest a cultural preference for beef consumption across Indus populations, supplemented by the consumption of mutton/lamb,” says the study. The research concludes that lipid profile examination revealed mostly the use of animal fats in vessels as 71% of the vessels yielded appreciable quantities of lipid. After studying the lipid profiles, the researchers looked into the type of food consumed during this period. For this, the team conducted an isotopic analysis of fatty acids to detect what type of meat was cooked in these ancient vessels. Explaining the significance of studying lipids for this research, the lead author, Dr Akshyeta Suryanarayan from the University of Cambridge, says: ""The study of lipid residues involves the extraction and identification of fats and oils that have been absorbed into ancient ceramic vessels during their use in the past. Lipids are relatively less prone to degradation and have been discovered in pottery from archaeological contexts around the world. However, they have seen very limited investigation in ancient ceramics from South Asia."" Game meat was integral to Indian diets since 70,000BC, says Manoshi Bhattacharya, a clinical nutritionist who has researched Indian dietary traditions. History suggests that beef and wild boar were consumed widely in ancient India as far back as the Indus valley civilisation. Animal and cow sacrifices were common in the Vedic era, between 1500 and 500BC - the meat was offered to the gods and then consumed at feasts. But as with every rule in Indian cuisine, there is an exception - some brahmin communities still eat meat. Kashmiri Pandits are famed for their rogan josh, a rich gravy of lamb or goat meat cooked with a heavy dose of red chillies; in Bengal and along the southern Konkan coast, a variety of fresh fish is eaten in brahmin homes. Mr Verma seems to be ignoring the fact that Ramadan is already under way and meat is a big part of the iftar or evening meal with which Muslims break their fast. But he also appears to believe that meat shops are owned and mostly frequented by Muslims - and that all Hindus across India, or even Delhi, celebrate Navratri. ""India has a very old meat-eating tradition and a very deep vegetarian tradition, which is also important. But I am often forced into taking a position [to defend one over the other]."" The irony, he adds, is that it's the progressives who defend meat-eating in India, unlike in the West where the left often argues for less meat on the table, and more sustainable, climate-friendly food habits. ""We are vegetarians who 'also' eat meat,"" Dr Bhattacharya says. ""It's deeply unfortunate because Indian traditions are more complex than that,"" says Vikram Doctor, an editor at The Economic Times who writes extensively about the country's food. Until now, the battle over food was largely restricted to beef. Hindus consider the cow sacred and its slaughter has long been banned in most Indian states. He's right - as someone from Hyderabad, a city famed for its Muslim cuisine, the dishes I count among my favourites are hard to find elsewhere - dalcha, a spicy soup of lentils and vegetables stewed with lamb; or tomato kut, eggs cooked and soaking in a thick, tangy tomato gravy. But, meat dishes were not really an embarrassment for the Harappans. In the face of mounting scientific evidence that this was a meat-eating society, there is a need to reconsider the views of what they might have been embarrassed by. They ate meat whenever they could, like any other people of the middle Bronze Age in Central, Middle and South Asia. “Our study of lipid residues in Indus pottery shows a dominance of animal products in vessels, such as the meat of non-ruminant animals like pigs, ruminant animals like cattle or buffalo and sheep or goat, as well as dairy products,” Suryanarayan said. The study of the residues inside the ceramic vessels recovered from the Harappan sites further substantiates the assumption that consumption of beef, goat, sheep and pig had been widespread. “This study is unique in the sense that it had a chance to look at the contents of the vessels. Normally there would be access to seeds or plant remains. But through the lipid residue analysis, we can confidently ascertain that consumption of beef, goat, sheep and pig was widespread, and especially of beef,’’ Suryanarayan was quoted as saying in The Indian Express. What did the ancient Harappans eat at the zenith of their civilisation, some 4,000 years ago? Were the ancient South Asian people vegetarian? “On the average, about 80% of the faunal assemblage from various Indus sites belongs to domestic animal species. Out of the domestic animals, cattle/buffalo are the most abundant, averaging between 50 and 60% of the animal bones found, with sheep/goat accounting for 10% of animal remains,” an earlier study had found. “The high proportions of cattle bones may suggest a cultural preference for beef consumption across Indus populations, supplemented by the consumption of mutton/lamb,” it stated. A recent paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science co-authored by Dr. Akshyeta Suryanarayan, former PhD student at the Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge, gives us some clues. Dr Suryanarayan and her team extracted and analysed lipid (organic compounds such as fatty acids or their derivatives) residues absorbed in 172 ceramic pottery fragments recovered from the rural and urban archaeological sites of the Harappan Civilisation in northwest India. Lipids extracted from these pots give us direct evidence of the predominance of animal products in the vessels. Earlier this year, from February 19 to 25, the National Museum in Delhi arranged a specially crafted tasting menu on Harappan food culture called ‘Historical Gastronomica - The Indus Dining Experience’. It included Khatti dal, Kachriki sabzi, black gram stewed with jaggery and sesame oil, raggi ladu, thin barley griddle cakes, sweet rice with banana and honey and a special ‘Indus Valley Khichri’. The ancient Mesopotamian Civilisation with whom the Harappans had trade links enjoyed a diet of fruits and vegetables as well as fish from the streams and rivers, along with livestock from their pens. Livestock included goats, pigs, and sheep. They would have augmented this diet through hunting game such as deer, gazelle and birds. The chief grain crop in Mesopotamia was barley. Based on the analysis of skeletal remains, several previous studies had suggested that cattle and water-buffalo served as the source of their dietary meat and dairy products, while their hides were used for various other purposes. Harappans also kept sheep and goats and hunted a wide range of wild animals such as deer, antelopes and wild boar. Lipid residues are relatively less prone to degradation and have been discovered in pottery from archaeological artifacts around the world. Pottery fragments were generally selected from contexts that had radiocarbon dates associated with them. During the Mature Harappan period, Rakhigarhi was a big city and Farmana was a town. Rest of the sites were villages. The wide range of sites gives an insight into the food habits of ancient South Asian urban and rural population. Researchers are getting a glimpse into ancient Indus Valley food choices by analyzing residues on ceramic pots from urban and rural settlements during the Mature Harappan period (c.2600/2500–1900 BC). It is a landmark study because this is the first multi-site analysis of fats and oils on pottery from the Indus Valley civilization. The results enable us to see and compare the popularity of some of the ancient Indus Valley foods across settlements and over time. Top Image: The analysis of fat residues on pottery reveals clues about ancient Indus Valley food preferences.        Source: sablinstanislav / Adobe Stock The researchers’ analyses of lipid residue on pottery from the various sites shows that there was an abundance of animal products in ancient Indus Valley cuisine. The researchers found evidence for the Indus Valley people eating the meat of pigs, cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats, and also consuming dairy products from the ancient ceramic vessels. “Our study of lipid residues in Indus pottery shows a dominance of animal products in vessels, such as the meat of non-ruminant animals like pigs, ruminant animals like cattle or buffalo and sheep or goat, as well as dairy products. However, as one of the first studies in the region there are interpretative challenges. Some of the results were quite unexpected, for example, we found a predominance of non-ruminant animal fats, even though the remains of animals like pigs are not found in large quantities in the Indus settlements. It is possible that plant products or mixtures of plant and animal products were also used in vessels, creating ambiguous results.” Complete vessel found during excavation at the Indus site of Lohari Ragho I, Haryana. Lipid residues on ancient pots are revealing new information on Indus Valley food choices and cooking. (Image: Cameron Petrie) Dr. Suryanarayan said in the press release that, “This study is the first to investigate absorbed lipid residues in pottery  from multiple Indus sites, including the Indus city of Rakhigarhi, as well as other Indus settlements of Farmana and Masudpur I and VII, allowing comparisons to be made across settlements and across time.” The researchers analyzed lipid residues on the pottery to find out what plant or animal products, such as fatty acids, remained and could provide them with chemical clues about ancient Indus Valley foods. Isotopic analysis allowed them to also discern between the fatty acids left by meat and milk. The analyses showed researchers what was cooked in different pots. In the press release, Dr. Suryanarayan explained the importance of studying these materials in the region: Dr. Cameron Petrie, of the University of Cambridge and one of the lead authors in the study mentioned some of the regional similarities and differences in Indus Valley  cuisine, saying that, “The products used in vessels across rural and urban Indus sites in northwest India are similar during the Mature Harappan period ( c.2600/2500-1900 BC). This suggests that even though urban and rural settlements were distinctive and people living in them used different types of material culture and pottery, they may have shared cooking practices and ways of preparing foodstuffs.” A University of Cambridge press release on the new study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science  says that the pottery with ancient Indus Valley foods’ fat residues  came from both rural and urban settlements  that are located across the modern states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The research team was led by Dr. Akshyeta Suryanarayan, former PhD student at the Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge and current postdoctoral researcher at CEPAM, UMR7264-CNRS, France . Dr. Suryanarayan also cautioned that “despite the high percentages of the remains of domestic ruminant animals found at these sites, there is very limited direct evidence of the use of dairy products  in vessels, including in perforated vessels that have been previously suggested to be linked to dairy processing. A recent Scientific Reports  study has reported more evidence of dairy products, primarily in bowls in Gujarat. Our results suggest that there may have been regional differences.” According to the researcher, “Analysis of more vessels from different sites would help us explore these potential patterns.” Bengaluru: The anachronistic structure of the Nobel Prizes was thrust into the spotlight when the prize-giving committee awarded the medicine prize for 2022 to Svante Pääbo for his contributions to palaeogenomics: the study of ancient humans using their DNA. Pääbo is a Swedish geneticist who helped found the field of palaeogenetics (contrary to an official press release‘s suggestion that he founded it all by himself). For many years until the advent of palaeogenomics, the study of human ancestors was dominated by palaeontology – the study of these ancestors’ bones and other fossil remains – and archaeology. In 2008, a team of researchers from Austria, Germany, Russia and the US, led by Pääbo, excavated a finger bone from the Denisova cave in the Altai mountains of Siberia. They were able isolate mitochondria in the cells of the bone and sequence the DNA in the mitochondria. “The data suggest that between 1 and 4% of the genomes of people in Eurasia are derived from Neandertals. Thus, while the Neandertal genome presents a challenge to the simplest version of an ‘out-of-Africa’ model for modern human origins, it continues to support the view that the vast majority of genetic variants that exist at appreciable frequencies outside Africa came from Africa with the spread of anatomically modern humans.” For all these findings, both the study paper and the Nobel Prize say that the principal achievement here was that scientists could retrieve and study DNA from many millennia ago. Evidence of the usefulness of the work of Pääbo & co. is the quantity of funds, time and interest that have been devoted to piecing together the ancient history of humans. Another study published in 2020, based on studying chemical residues in artefacts, reported that the Harappan diet included pig and buffalo meat – further defying attempts by nationalists in government to assimilate the Harappan civilisation into their revisionist narratives. Two of Pääbo’s findings stand out in his career as a geneticist: the sequencing of Neandertal DNA in 2009 and the discovery of the Denisovan hominin in 2010. Both archaeogenomics and palaeogenomics have opened wide windows into the way humans have travelled, cultivated crops, organised themselves and survived natural disasters through several centuries. Today, in 2022, archaeogenomic and palaeogenomic insights are also part of the identity politics dominant in many countries, including India. The team’s analysis further indicated that the common ancestor of Neandertals, Homo sapiens and Homo denisova lived at least 0.78-1.3 million years ago. The team also reported that the Denisovan mtDNA had twice as many differences from modern human mtDNA as the Neandertal DNA did, meaning that the Denisovan hominins were genetically more separated from modern humans than the Neandertals. The work of Svante Pääbo and his peers from around the world have been instrumental to understand how the human story first began and how the various subsequent chapters can be put together. Today, scientists in countries like India are instrumental to plugging important nationally relevant gaps in this book, deciding how the book itself will end and – crucially – whether it will survive their governments. It is important for the Hindutva nationalist project that the originators of the Vedas, simply called the Vedic people, first emerged in modern-day India and emigrated to other parts of the world. But recent genomic studies – especially two that were published in 2019 – have found evidence for the opposite: that these individuals migrated to India from Eastern Europe during the late Harappan period."

Srinagar: President of India, Ramnath Kovind on Tuesday appointed Justice Rajesh Bindal as the acting chief justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court. The notification dated 8 December issued pursuant to the retirement of Chief Justice Gita Mittal, who will demit the office today, reported LiveLaw. A Full Court Reference at the Jammu and Kashmir High Court took place today to bid farewell to the Chief Justice. “When God closes one door, he opens palace doors for you; I truly believe that. I’m sure another door will open for me tomorrow,” Justice Mittal said in her farewell speech. The order issued by the Government of India’s Ministry of Law and Justice (Department of Justice) stated that Justice Rajesh Bindal, the senior-most Judge of Common High Court for the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh, will perform the duties of the office of Chief Justice of that High Court with effect from 9 December 2020, tomorrow, consequent upon the retirement of Justice Gita Mittal, Chief Justice. On Tuesday, the President of India appointed Justice Rajesh Bindal as the acting chief justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court. Justice Ali Mohammad Magrey, who hails from J&K, on October 13 took oath as Chief Justice (CJ) of the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh at Srinagar’s Kashmir International Convention Centre (KICC). Earlier on September 30 this year, a five-member Supreme Court (SC) collegium had recommended Justice Magrey for the post. It had recommended the transfer of the incumbent Chief Justice Pankaj Mithal to the Rajasthan High Court. In the 17 months that have passed since she retired on 9 December, 2020, Justice Mittal has been appointed chairperson of the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) — an independent, self-regulatory body for non-news general entertainment channels set up by the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF). She has also been called on by the Supreme Court in at least two matters — one, for creating vulnerable witness deposition centres throughout the country, and second, a dispute over repair works in a housing society formed among members of the Supreme Court Bar Association. In February this year, in what seemed like a return to sports for Justice Mittal, but in a different capacity, the Delhi HC appointed her as chairperson of the Committee of Administrators (CoA) to manage the affairs of the TTFI, the governing body for table tennis in the country, which was suspended in February. The committee also includes senior advocate Chetan Mittal and former athlete SD Mudgil. New Delhi: From chairing a committee to create a safer environment for ‘vulnerable witnesses’ to record their depositions in courts, to helming a panel that has taken over operations of the now-suspended Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) — Gita Mittal, former chief justice of the Jammu & Kashmir High Court, has kept busy since she retired in December 2020. In July last year, when a dispute arose with regard to repair work and restoration of apartments located in Noida’s Sector 99, for a cooperative housing society formed among members of the Supreme Court Bar Association, the apex court turned to Justice Mittal to intervene and chair a meeting between members of the Supreme Towers Apartment Owners Association (STAOA). Justice Mittal submitted a report before the court in August. Copyright © 2023 Printline Media Pvt. Ltd. All rights reserved. The issue came to light after the principal sessions judge in Srinagar, Abdul Rashid Malik, on December 7 referred the bail application of one Sheikh Salman to Chief Justice Gita Mittal, who was retiring the same day, in an order that read: “This application has come up today for hearing. At 9.51 AM, the under-signed received a call from Mr Tariq Ahmad Mota, Secretary to Hon’ble Mr Justice Javid Iqbal Wani.” A senior lawyer pointed out that Justice Wani is the son-in-law of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association president Mian Abdul Qayoom. As a senior additional advocate general of the state, he had opposed the release of his father-in-law who was detained under the Public Safety Act in 2019, when the Centre downgraded Jammu and Kashmir’s constitutional status. He became a HC judge in June this year. New Delhi: Legal luminaries have expressed their angst at the manner in which directions were allegedly issued to a principal sessions judge in Srinagar by the secretary of a Jammu and Kashmir high court judge to not grant bail to an applicant. “The father-in-law of Justice Wani was president of the Kashmir Bar and was detained in August 2019 and this judge himself prosecuted his father-in-law as a lawyer. He is apparently an ‘independent spirit’ who is not liked by the local Bar and nor by the administration. So there may be more than what meets the eye,” the lawyer insinuated. Hegde demanded an investigation into the matte. However, he pointed out that “a high court judge cannot be punished except through impeachment” and that “a transfer is not a punishment.” As for the secretary who issued the direction, he said, there can be an administrative inquiry. The Jammu and Kamir International Arbitration Centre (JKIAC) was set up pursuant to the approval accorded by the High Court with Wings at Srinagar and Jammu for facilitating the objective of dispute resolution by the process of arbitration. The Centre has an illustrious panel of arbitrators consisting of eminent legal personalities including retired Chief Justices of India, retired Judges of Supreme Court, all retired Chief Justices and Judges of High Court of Jammu &Kamir and Ladakh, Lawyers, former judicial officers, Chartered Accountants, Bureaucrats, Engineers, Architects, Professors etc. Justice Gita Mittal, Chief Justice of Common High Court of Jammu &Kamir and Ladakh, today inaugurated the Jammu Centre of the Jammu &Kamir International Arbitration Centre here at the ADR Building, District Court Complex, Jammu.

Jammu, Dec 15: Supreme Court collegium has approved the proposal for appointment of Justice Pankaj Mithal, first puisne Judge of Allahabad High Court as Chief Justice of common High Court of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Union Territory Ladakh.Reliable sources told EXCELSIOR, “the collegium comprising Chief Justice of India S A Bobde and two senior most Judges in their meeting yesterday had recommended the proposal for transfer of present Acting Chief Justice of J&K High Court Justice Rajesh Bindal to Calcutta High Court and appointment of Justice Mithal as Chief Justice of J&K High Court”.Source also confirmed, “Justice Rajesh Bindal after his transfer to Calcutta High Court is likely to join as first puisne Judge”. Presently the Calcutta High Court is headed by Justice Thottathil B. Nair Radhakrishnan, who took over as Chief Justice on April 4, 2019 and is likely to retire on April next year.Sources elaborated, “most likely this would be the last meeting of the collegium before the Apex Court closes for the winter vacation starting from December 21 till January 1, 2021. Besides appointing Chief Justice for J&K High Court, the collegium also approved transfer of Andhra Pradesh Chief Justice A K Maheshwari to Sikkim High Court”.The confrontation between Justice Maheshwari and Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, Government had snowballed into a major controversy after former issued a gag order in the Amravati land deals case. The Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister had also met the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi to highlight his concerns and had also taken up the matter with Chief Justice of India.Presently, Justice Pankaj Mithal is first puisne Judge of Allahabad High Court and is heading the Lucknow Bench.Justice Mithal had been elevated as Additional Judge to High Court in July 7, 2006 and took oath as permanent Judge on July 2, 2008. Prior to this, he had worked as Standing Counsel, U.P Avas Evam Vikas Parishad, Lucknow since 1990 and as Standing Counsel of Dr B R Ambedkar University, Agra.He was enrolled as an advocate in Bar Council of UP in the year 1985 and subsequently started his practise.Justice Mithal graduated in Commerce from Allahabad University in 1982 and passed LLB from Meerut College, affiliated to Ch. Charan Singh University in year 1985.It is pertinent to mention here that only a week back Union Law Ministry had issued a notification appointing Justice Rajesh Bindal as the Acting Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court.Being the senior-most Judge of the High Court, he had been asked to perform the duties of the office of Chief Justice with effect from December 9 consequent upon the retirement of the then Chief Justice Gita Mittal.Justice Bindal, who joined Jammu and Kashmir High Court on November 19, 2018 is presently theChairman of the Finance Committee, Building and Infrastructure Committee, Information Technology Committee and State Court Management Systems Committee in the High Court. He is also Chairman of J&K State Legal Service Authority.Justice Bindal is also the Chairman of the Committee constituted for conducting assessment for optimal use of technology by National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) and the State Legal Services Authorities including use of Artificial Intelligence. He is also Member of the Committee constituted to go into the existing framework of Lok Adalats and Mediation and to suggest ways for enhancing operational efficiency and methods for better application of these ADR mechanisms for weaker sections of the society. Srinagar: The Chief Justice of High Court of Jammu and Kashmir, Gita Mittal, has written to Dr Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State, seeking the establishment of the Administrative Tribunal with multiple benches having permanent seats in Jammu and Srinagar. The move came after a Central government order by virtue of which about 38,000 cases pertaining to service matters, pending before the J&K High Court, were shifted to Chandigarh. The move did not elicit any reaction in Kashmir valley, but the Jammu Bar Association and lawyers, along with government employees, showed their resentment against the move. A Jammu-based lawyer said, “This decision of the government will leave hundreds of lawyers in Jammu jobless and will also have an impact on over 6 lakh government employs in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.”  He said that employees and their lawyers, both retired and working, will now have to travel to Chandigarh as their cases will be heard there. © SUNDAY GUARDIAN LIVE 2023 | DIRECT NEWS PRIVATE LIMITED | ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

While trade relations and Indian expatriates were negatively impacted, the flow of investments from GCC to India witnessed an upswing. The cooperation and coordination in the fight against the pandemic was an important positive underlining the strong bilateral bonds. A continuity in terms of political and diplomatic contacts through digital meetings, telephonic conversations and virtual diplomacy, was notable. In the last two months of 2020, India undertookconcentrated efforts to rejuvenate its relations with GCC countries. It is now time for India and GCC to start looking beyond the pandemic to develop cooperation in new and emerging areas, identified above, and tap the infinite potentials for further strengthening the bilateral relations. During the pandemic, there was an increased use  of technology to maintain high-level political contacts. Video conferencing and  telephone conversations, along with the exchange of medical and pharmaceutical equipment  and personnel, gave rise to new terms such as ‘virtual diplomacy’ and ‘COVID  diplomacy’. Prime Minister Modi held telephonic conversations with GCC leaders  on several occasions.   On March 17, 2020, in his conversation with Crown  Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, Modi urged the G-20 (with Riyadh  being the current Chair of the group) to take a leadership role in the fight  against the pandemic.12 On March 26, the prime minister held conversations with Abu Dhabi’s Crown  Prince, Mohammed bin Zayed and Qatari Emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. On April  1, Modi held talks with Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sabah Al-Khaled Al-Sabah.  On April 6, 2020, the prime minister talked to  King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa of Bahrain, and discussed the health crisis and  consequences of COVID-19, “including on  logistics chains and financial markets.”13 The issue of welfare of  Indian workers was raised and the King assured the prime minister of their  welfare. On April 7, the prime minister talked to Sultan Haitham bin  Tariq of Oman, and the two leaders “discussed the health and economic  challenges” posed by COVID-19.  As part of the ‘Covid diplomacy’, medical  support and aid was exchanged. At the request of the Kuwaiti government, on  April 11, an Indian rapid response team comprising 15  doctors and health professionals was sent to Kuwait.14 On April 19, India dispatched a shipment of 5.5 million  hydroxychloroquine pills to the UAE.15 On May 2, India received 7 metric tons of  medical supplies from the UAE.16 India also sent a team of 88 medical  professionals to the UAE.17  As the situation started to get a sense of  normalcy, New Delhi began taking concentrated steps to re-engage the GCC  countries, External Affairs Minister (EAM) Dr. S. Jaishankar and Minister of  State (MoS) for External Affairs, V. Muraleedharan, paid back-to-back visits to  the region. On November 24-25, the EAM undertook a two-day visit of Bahrain,  wherein he met with the Bahraini leadership, including Crown Prince Salman bin  Hamad Al-Khalifa and conveyed condolences on the demise of Bahraini Prime  Minister, Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa, earlier that month.   Dr. Jaishankar held wide-ranging discussions  with his Bahraini counterpart Dr. Abdullatif bin Rashid Al-Zayani and the two  leaders agreed to “further strengthen the historic India-Bahrain ties including  in areas of defence and maritime security, space technology, trade and  investment, infrastructure, IT, FinTech, health, hydrocarbon and renewable  energy.”18 Dr. Jaishankar invited Dr. Al-Zayani to visit New Delhi to participate in the  third India-Bahrain High Joint Commission meeting.  During the same tour, he visited the UAE on  November 25-26. He called on Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and  held discussions with his counterpart Abdullah bin Zayed. COVID-19 and its  impacts on the healthcare and economy formed the bulk of the discussions and  the two sides “reviewed their cooperation on  various facets of their comprehensive strategic partnership including trade,  investment, infrastructure, energy, food security and defence.”19 Regional and  international developments also came up for discussion and both agreed to  continue coordination on issues of mutual interest.  On December 26-27, the EAM travelled to Qatar.  Dr. Jaishankar called on Qatari leaders including Father Emir Hamad Al-Thani  and Emir Tamim and thanked the Qatari leadership for taking care of the Indian  community during the pandemic. He also met Prime Minister and Interior Minister  Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and held wide-ranging talks with his counterpart  Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, wherein both sides agreed to “strengthen the  multifaceted bilateral relationship in areas such as energy, trade, investment,  food processing, healthcare, education, culture, defence and security.”20  MoS Muraleedharan visited Oman on December 16-17  and met the foreign and labor ministers of the Sultanate.21 Issues related to COVID-19 and its impact on the economy and Indian concerns  regarding its citizens working in Oman were discussed. The visit built on the  discussions held between Prime Minister Modi and Sultan Haitham in April, the  virtual Joint Commission Meeting held in October and the virtual meeting  between the EAM and Omani Foreign Minister, on December 2.   Besides, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas  Dharmendra Pradhan visited Kuwait in October and the Chief of the Army Staff  (COAS), General M. M. Naravane visited the UAE and Saudi Arabia in December. Pradhan  conveyed a message of condolence from the President and Prime Minister of India  on the demise of Emir Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who passed away in  September. He also congratulated Emir Nawaf Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on  assuming the responsibility on behalf of India. Kuwait’s contribution to  India’s energy security was also discussed during the visit and the two sides  agreed to continue cooperation in all areas of bilateral relations.22  While Gen. Naravane’s was a historic first visit  by an Indian COAS to the two GCC countries, it was not an isolated incident  given India’s growing security and defence ties with the UAE and Saudi Arabia.  The COAS met with senior military officials in both countries and discussed  ways to strengthen defence cooperation, including in manufacturing, training  and joint exercises.23  These high-level visits underline the efforts by  New Delhi to shrug off the economic impact of the pandemic and boost its  commercial and security cooperation with the GCC countries. The efforts are  significant given the changing regional realignments. Developments such as  normalisation between Bahrain and UAE and Israel24 and the breakthrough in the three-and-half-year crisis within the GCC after the  Al-Ula Declaration25 — both of which were welcomed by India, are important. The interactions underline  that New Delhi is conscious of the changing regional dynamics and supports efforts  that can help build regional security and stability. India’s relations with the Gulf Cooperation  Council (GCC) countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  (UAE), have witnessed a significant upswing since 2015, across the areas of trade,  investments, counter-terrorism and security cooperation. Regional and  international developments, including the rise of Islamic State (ISIS), China’s  growing regional footprint, as well as heightened tensions over Iran’s nuclear  program, also contributed to amplifying the importance of the GCC states in India’s  foreign policy calculus.  The growing ties, however, had to endure the  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. All aspects of bilateral relations, including  trade, investments, flow of workers and pilgrims, and above all, physical  high-level political contacts, were seriously curtailed. Nonetheless, New Delhi  kept the diplomatic channels with the GCC countries open, with Prime Minister  Narendra Modi holding several telephonic conversations with the Gulf leaders.  India and the GCC countries exchanged medical supplies and personnel to help each  other fight the pandemic. With the world gradually getting back to normalcy and  economic and trade activities regaining strength, India-GCC relations too are expected  to attain the vibrancy of pre-COVID days.  The Brief maps the disruptions caused by  COVID-19 in India’s relations with the GCC countries and underlines the efforts  undertaken to help rejuvenate bilateral ties. It further highlights the issues  that continue to pose a challenge and suggests policy initiatives in new areas  that can supplement the efforts currently underway. The pandemic has brought to fore new  possibilities for cooperation between India and the GCC countries. Firstly,  there is immense scope for investments in the healthcare and the pharmaceutical  industries. India is already a popular regional destination for medical  tourism. Digital healthcare services are an area that are likely to witness immense  growth in the near future. The demand for hygiene and personal protective  equipment (PPE) products has already skyrocketed. India has emerged as a major  manufacturing hub for these products, apart from its strengths as a  pharmaceutical manufacturing hub. There are immense possibilities to attract  investments from the GCC countries in these emerging sectors. It fits well into  Government of India’s initiative to develop the industrial and manufacturing  base in India under the Atmanirbhar Bharat program. There are  also possibilities to attract investments in the Ayurveda healthcare ventures  which has a growing market in the Gulf region.  Secondly, higher education is an area that  remains under-exploited, despite the potential for enhanced cooperation. Given  that the Indian ‘Institutions of Eminence’ have now been given the green signal  to set up branches outside India,26 IITs and IIMs should look for possibilities for opening branches in the GCC  countries which will attract both the local and expatriate population. India  should also make concentrated efforts to attract students from Gulf countries  to join its higher educational institutions for professional courses. India  already attracts a large number of students from its immediate neighborhood and  in th recent years, students from GCC countries have begun to look for  international destinations such as the US, Europe, Australia, China and Japan  to gain professional education. The vast network of professional colleges and  universities in India can be an attractive destination for GCC students. The  field of digital education services can also be an area to attract GCC  investments and strengthen bilateral cooperation.  Thirdly, there are immense possibilities for  cooperation in the field of defense manufacturing. India and the GCC countries  have witnessed an extraordinary growth in bilateral defense relations under  Prime Minister Modi. The Government of India has in May 2020 increased the  limit for FDI in defense manufacturing industry from 49 per cent to 74 per cent  through direct route, while 100 per cent FDI is possible through government  route. This can be a major area to attract investments, especially as the GCC  countries are among the world’s top defense importers. There is also a  possibility of a multilateral cooperation among India, the UAE and Israel,  given that India already has strong bilateral cooperation with both these  countries in the defense and security fields.   Finally, niche areas such as space exploration,  artificial intelligence, cyber security, bioinformatics, renewable energy etc.  can be the new areas for cooperation between India and GCC countries. The UAE  is fast emerging as a space exploration leader in the Arab world. The GCC  countries, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia, have in recent years invested  significantly in the renewable energy sector. India, being an energy-deficient  country with a walloping hunger for energy, should explore possibilities for enhancing  cooperation in this sector. Govt agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties with Colombia following election of Gustavo Petro as president, Mexico talks remained on hold, and opposition parties began preparations for “open primaries” ahead of 2024 elections. Govt and incoming Colombian administration 28 July agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations. In joint declaration, FM Carlos Faria and Alvaro Leyva, Colombia’s designated foreign minister under incoming President Petro, said both govts will appoint ambassadors to their respective capitals and work to strengthen security along their shared border. Elsewhere on diplomatic front, top govt official 25 July insisted that if U.S. wanted access to Venezuelan oil and gas, it would have to “negotiate [directly] with the Government”. FM Faria 4 July met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, where they announced further cooperation to skirt U.S. sanctions and on investment projects. Mexico talks between govt and opposition remained suspended. Meanwhile, some opposition political parties geared up for “open primaries” announced in June by opposition alliance Unitary Platform to select candidate for 2024 presidential election. Notably, Primero Justicia party (Unitary Platform member) 9 July held internal elections for over 12,000 national, regional, municipal and parish representatives, while opposition figure Henri Falcón 18 July announced his newly created Movimiento party will participate in Unitary Platform’s primaries. Security forces 4-7 July arrested trade union activists and members of left-wing anti-Maduro party Bandera Roja, charging five of them under anti-terrorist and organised crime laws. Local human rights organisation Provea 13 July said arrests followed same pattern of harassment of civil society activists documented by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in report published late June. After delegation led by U.S. President Biden’s chief hostage negotiator late June failed to secure release of two U.S. hostages, media outlet Associated Press 13 July gave details of three other unreported cases of U.S. citizens arrested in Venezuela this year who are still detained. All three – two of whom were detained after high-level U.S. delegation visited Caracas in March – were accused of illegally entering country from Colombia. President-elect Petro strengthened governing coalition and agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations with Venezuela, while Gulf Clan and other criminal organisations signalled willingness for talks. President-elect Petro throughout month worked to build broad coalition of political parties and figures ahead of his inauguration on 7 August. Notably, Petro 13, 19 July won support of Liberal party and Partido de la U, respectively, reaching historic majority in both chambers of congress. Meanwhile, incoming govt 28 July agreed with Venezuela to reestablish diplomatic relations. In joint declaration, Alvaro Leyva, designated FM under Petro, and Venezuelan FM Carlos Faria said both govts will appoint ambassadors to their respective capitals and work to strengthen security along their shared border. Incoming govt and criminal groups hinted at willingness for future negotiations. Petro 5 July told W Radio media outlet that his govt would work to achieve ceasefire with National Liberation Army (ELN) in order to resume peace talks and encourage dialogue with other armed groups. Gulf Clan and some smaller criminal organisations 21 July published open letter stating their willingness to negotiate ceasefire. In apparent bid by ELN to consolidate territorial control ahead of possible talks with govt, clashes between ELN and rival armed organisations increased in group’s major strongholds. Notably, clashes 9-14 July broke out between ELN and remnants of dissident Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) Fronts 10 and 28 in Tame municipality, Arauca department (north east); security forces 21 July clashed with ELN in Teorama municipality, Norte de Santander department (north east), leaving one soldier dead. Violence persisted elsewhere. Notably, unknown assailants 31 July shot dead five in La Union municipality, Valle del Cauca department; unknown gunmen same day killed four Indigenous people in Barbacoas municipality, Chocó department (along Pacific coast). Meanwhile, local media 2 July reported that former FARC chief negotiator and leader of Segunda Marquetalia dissident faction, Iván Márquez, had been wounded or killed in Venezuela; statements from Segunda Marquetalia 10 July indicated that Márquez had survived attack and remained in Venezuela. Defence Minister Diego Molano 15 July said security forces killed Iván Mordisco, leader of FARC’s former 1st Front, which never joined peace process. President Rahmon visited Kyrgyzstan along with leaders from five Central Asian states in summit designed to strengthen regional cooperation. Kyrgyzstan 20-21 July hosted President Rahmon along with leaders of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan in Issyk-Kul Lake town of Cholpon-Ata to discuss economic and political cooperation in wake of Ukraine war, COVID-19 pandemic, social unrest and situation in Afghanistan. Summit marked first gathering of regional heads of state since Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 Feb (see Ukraine) and ended with pledge to increase cooperation. Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, however, did not sign off on treaty committing countries to “friendship, good neighbourliness and cooperation”, citing domestic procedures. Meanwhile, 146 women and children 25 July were repatriated to Tajikistan from refugee camp in Syria, where relatives of ISIS militants were reportedly being held. U.S. President Biden attended multilateral summit in Jeddah, while govt announced minor confidence-building measures with Israel. U.S. President Biden 15-16 July visited Saudi Arabia to attend bilateral U.S.-Saudi meeting and Gulf Cooperation Council+3 (Iraq, Egypt and Jordan) summit in Jeddah city; Biden 15 July met King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In small confidence-building steps, Saudi Arabia 15 July opened airspace to all air carriers, including flights to and from Israel; U.S. same day announced deal to remove multinational peacekeeping mission from disputed Red Sea island Tiran by end of year, indicating Saudi recognition of Israel’s maritime access to Red Sea. President Mohamud went on regional tour to reset foreign policy; deadly firefight erupted between Puntland state security units; Al-Shabaab targeted Ethiopian police units near and across border with Ethiopia. Mohamud in July travelled to Turkey, Eritrea, Kenya, Djibouti, Tanzania and Egypt in search of external support ahead of implementing ambitious internal agenda, including on security. During 9-12 July visit to Eritrea, Mohamud notably visited Somali troops undergoing military training in Eritrea since 2019, amid long-running controversy around program participants’ alleged deployment in Ethiopia’s Tigray region; later renewed pledge to bring soldiers home. In Kenya, Mohamud 15 July signed 11-point agreement aimed at improving ties with neighbour, including resuming trade of khat stimulant and flights by Kenya’s national carrier Kenya Airways to Mogadishu. Security incident highlighted ongoing fault lines in Puntland state following Puntland leader Said Deni’s failed bid to become president in May, along with Puntland’s uneasiness with federal govt. Puntland Security Force (PSF) 11 July clashed with Puntland Maritime Police Force at Bosasso airport (Bari region) during landing clearance dispute for aircraft carrying federal parliament’s Lower House deputy speaker and then-acting Somali president, Sadia Samatar, leaving about 20 people dead. Meanwhile in South West state, Al-Shabaab launched most significant attack along Ethiopian border in years before making rare incursions into Ethiopia (see Ethiopia): up to hundreds of Al-Shabaab militants 20 July clashed with Ethiopian police units in Yeed and Aato villages, Bakool region; security officials claimed 17 Ethiopian police officers and 63 Al-Shabaab killed. Renewed clashes reported 29 July in Aato. Also in South West state, explosive attacks in Marka and Afgoye towns (Lower Shabelle region) 27 July killed at least 16, including Marka’s district commissioner. Elsewhere, Al-Shabaab 17 July detonated vehicle packed with explosives at hotel in Jowhar city (Middle Shabelle region), where Hirshabelle state officials were meeting, leaving up to seven dead and others injured. U.S. military killed two Al-Shabaab fighters in 17 July airstrike in Jubaland state. CrisisWatch is our global conflict tracker, a tool designed to help decision-makers prevent deadly violence by keeping them up-to-date with developments in over 70 conflicts and crises, identifying trends and alerting them to risks of escalation and opportunities to advance peace. Controversial proposal to extend coalition govt’s time in power beyond Feb 2023 ratcheted up political tensions; violence continued in multiple areas. Media outlets late July reported President Kiir and VP Machar around 26 July agreed to extend their time in power for 24 months after end of 2018 peace deal’s transitional period in Feb 2023. Earlier in month, after senior Kiir allies 15 July submitted draft roadmap detailing extension plan to complete peace agreement’s implementation, Machar’s Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army-In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO), civil society actors and other political leaders criticised lack of deliberation and called for more inclusive process to define way ahead. Dissident Gen Stephen Buay Rolnyang 9 July called to replace Kiir and Machar through violence, while holdout opposition leaders Thomas Cirillo and Paul Malong, Pagan Amum and others 15 July announced broader opposition alliance. U.S. 15 July confirmed withdrawing funding to peace-monitoring bodies, citing a lack of progress on peace deal provisions. Meanwhile, South Sudan People’s Movement/Army (SSPM/A) led by Gen Stephen Buay Rolnyang late July engaged in hostilities in Mayom county, Unity state, with over 30 fatalities recorded; notably, group 22 July killed Mayom county commissioner, 26 July attacked South Sudan People’s Defense Forces (SSDPF) reinforcement convoy. Violence flared in Eastern Equatoria state when suspected ethnic Murle, Tennet and Buya gunmen 7 July launched cattle raid in Kapoeta North County; county commissioner 11 July claimed about 235 people killed, but figure likely exaggerated. Also in Eastern Equatoria, armed men 11 July shot dead chief of Madi ethnic group in Nimule city (Magwi county), prompting locals to accuse Dinka Bor cattle keepers. Kitgwang faction, which split from Machar’s SPLM/A-IO in 2021, split again when its deputy leader, Gen Johnson Olony, 12 July attempted to replace Gen Simon Gatwech as faction leader; internal tensions mid- to late July led to clashes in Magenis area (Upper Nile state), Pieri town (Jonglei state) and Panyikang county (Upper Nile state), while political cadres and military commanders met in Khartoum to contain crisis. Meanwhile, controversy persisted over dredging of Nile tributaries. In response to public outcry against initiative, Kiir 11 July halted dredging activities until further environmental assessments are completed. In long-awaited step toward national reconciliation, President Ouattara met with former Presidents Gbagbo and Bédié; govt engaged in diplomatic battle with Mali over arrest of Ivorian soldiers in country. Long-time rivals Ouattara, Gbagbo and Bédié 14 July met at presidential palace in economic capital Abidjan in first trilateral encounter since 2010-2011 post-election violence; discussions focused on national reconciliation and political dialogue ahead of 2025 presidential election, possibly touching on release of political and military prisoners incarcerated during 2010-2011 crisis, and return of prominent exiles such as former Minister Charles Blé Goudé; Ouattara proposed making such meetings a regular occurrence. Govt pursued efforts to tackle insecurity in country’s north amid recurrent jihadist attacks along border with Burkina Faso. Ouattara’s brother, Defence Minister Téné Birahima Ouattara, 12 July participated in donor conference in France on financing of International Counter-Terrorism Academy, which was inaugurated in June 2021 near Jacqueville town. French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu 16 July met with president and his brother in Abidjan to discuss bilateral cooperation to contain jihadist threat in West Africa. Meanwhile, Malian authorities 10 July arrested 49 Ivorian soldiers at Bamako International Airport, labelling them “mercenaries” attempting to destabilise transition. Ivorian govt 12 July said soldiers were part of UN stabilisation mission in Mali (MINUSMA), urged Bamako to release them. Togo-led mediation launched around 19 July. MINUSMA 26 July said “dysfunctions” may have led to crisis, acknowledging that “certain measures were not taken” ahead of Ivorian troops’ arrival (see Mali). Tensions rose late month amid govt plans to issue temporary IDs for Serbs entering country, with protesters in Serb-majority area setting up roadblocks and reportedly shooting at police. Following decision late June to issue Kosovo ID cards to citizens entering with Serb-issued documents, and to give drivers until 30 Sept to obtain Kosovo licence plates, authorities 25 July said all preparations were complete for new rule to begin by 1 Aug. However, decision fuelled frustration in northern Kosovo, prompting some to take to streets. Notably, protesters in majority Serb North Mitrovica town 31 July set roadblocks at two border crossing points with Serbia while police reported shots fired, harassment of passing Albanian civilians and attacks on cars. Govt condemned unrest while pledging to postpone implementation of new rule until 1 Sept. Serbian President Vučić same day said “Serbs will not suffer any more cruelty” but that Serbian govt “would try to preserve peace at all costs”; PM Kurti meanwhile defended reciprocity measures. NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo same day stated readiness “to intervene if stability is jeopardized in the north of Kosovo”. Earlier, European Parliament 6 July called for “comprehensive, legally binding normalisation agreement” between Serbia and Kosovo to further progress on EU accession; Serbian President Vučić same day said Serbia “won’t consider” mutual recognition of Kosovo and Serbia. EU Special Representative for Belgrade-Pristina dialogue Miroslav Lajčák 10 July announced that Serbian and Kosovar leaders had agreed to meet during month; similarly, Kosovar President Osmani 4 July said she believed “there will be a meeting” between leaders. Lajčák 20 July said Kosovo and Serbia needed to agree on meaning of normalisation and conceded that “it’s better to wait a little and make sure the meeting is successful”; he nonetheless stipulated that meeting should not be postponed again and that it should take place by Sept. Meanwhile, European Council 18 July reconfirmed “desire to intensify the EU-facilitated Dialogue” by extending Lajčák’s mandate until Aug 2024."

Authorities from Nepal and China jointly announced the new number in a virtual event Tuesday, months after teams from the two countries separately measured the mountain. The world’s highest mountain just got a little higher. The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest's height earlier this year. China and Nepal jointly presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The two had diverged for years over the mountain's actual height. How high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain's height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills. BEIJING -- The world's highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story. The new height is 0.86 metres (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries' two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The agreement announced Tuesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between them. The mountain's height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down. (Want to climb Mount Everest? Here is what you need to know.) Historians still don’t know whether Mallory and Irvine made it to the top of Everest. What do you think? This is 86 centimeters higher than the measurement previously recognised by Nepal. It is more than four meters above China's official figure. Also read |Explained: Why did Mount Everest’s height change? The world’s highest mountain is now officially a little higher. After years of debate,China and Nepal finally agreed on a precise elevation forMount Everest . The new agreed height of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.69 feet) was announced at a virtual ceremony. While some scientists believe the 2015 Nepal quake shortened Everest, there are reports that the ""new"" height about to be announced by Nepal and China may actually be taller. Other scientists say that's far too conservative, and the growth could be three times that much. But however fast Everest is rising, things can happen very quickly to change that: earthquakes. In fact, if you were to measure mountains from the Earth's core – which some scientists think will increasingly be a safer constant, as climate change makes sea levels rise — there's a mountain in Ecuador that would be higher than Everest. The summit of Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo is more than 6,800 feet farther from the Earth's core, than Everest's summit is. So China and Nepal, on whose borders Everest stands, decided it's time to re-measure Everest. But they haven't always in the past. A 2005 Chinese survey concluded the mountain was 12 feet shorter than previously thought. So some climbers rushed to climb from the Nepal side, where they were still certifying the higher height. It may have cost China some mountaineering tourism. If all that work gets more attention, because it involves the tallest mountain in the world, then that's a good thing for science, they say. Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak, seen from Syangboche in Nepal.

Nepal had indicated its desire to review various issues related to trade and transit arrangements during Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s visit to Kathmandu last month. Did China engineer this border dispute between India and Nepal? Why did India build this road through territory claimed by Nepal? Yes, the current border dispute reflects a growing structural problem in India-Nepal relations. C. Raja Mohan thus identifies the territorial dispute as “merely a symptom of the structural changes unfolding in the external and internal context of the bilateral relationship.” Does this crisis reflect a failure of India’s Neighbourhood First policy? Does this dispute reflect a deeper problem in India-Nepal relations? Is China’s political influence in Nepal harming Indian interests? Will India ever give up control over the territory claimed by Nepal? At the root of the issue may also be differing interpretations of what exactly warrants a diplomatic dialogue. On the one hand, in Nepal’s maximalist perspective, this should cover all territories it claims, now also including Limpyadhura. The thinking in Kathmandu goes that if India conveys its own territorial claims in official maps, does it have any legitimacy to pressure Nepal not to come up with its own? On the other hand, in India’s minimalist perspective, perhaps reflecting why it delayed dialogue, the issue is seen to be more of a technical nature, focused on delimitation, boundary pillars etc. The current crisis has exposed the extent to which both countries’ interpretations clash and the different levels of priority. As noted by Dinesh Bhattarai, a former Nepali diplomat, the border dispute “looks minor, but allowing it to fester is likely to sow the seeds of immense competition and intense rivalry in the sensitive Himalayan frontier with far-reaching geopolitical implications.” Similarly, Indian scholar and Nepal expert S. D. Muni cautions that, sooner or later, the dispute “will be exploited by the third parties to their advantage.” Nepal govt on #indiachinastandoff :Nepal maintains that disputes between the countries should be resolved through peaceful means. 1/n@IndianExpress Anurag Srivastava, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, while responding to the claim by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian that “Galwan Valley is located on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control”, said: “the Chinese side departed from these understandings in respect of the LAC in the Galwan Valley area and sought to erect structures just across the LAC” and that Beijing’s claim to Galwan “are not in accordance with China’s own position in the past” – not since the Sino-Indian war of 1962.

China has lodged representations and protests on multiple occasions but India has gone even further to cross the LAC and made provocations. India: Indian troops are familiar with the alignment of LAC in all sectors of border areas, including in Galwan Valley. They abide by it scrupulously, as they do elsewhere. The Indian side has never undertaken any actions across the LAC. In fact, they have been patrolling this area for a long time without any incident. All infrastructure built by the Indian side is naturally on its own side. Click here to read more.

At the level of global institutions, Indian officials believe that China seeks to stymie India’s ambitions on the international stage by blocking its membership in organizations such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the United Nations Security Council. China, in turn, worries that greater Indian coordination with the United States in multilateral institutions such as the Financial Action Task Force, the United Nations, and the World Intellectual Property Organization will threaten Chinese interests."

United were coming off a disastrous 2021-22 campaign where despite Ronaldo’s above average goal tally (24 goals in all competitions), the team failed to win any silverware or finish in the top four of the Premier League. For many observers, Ronaldo’s game was already on its way down, despite his managing to score the odd goal. What followed was a cold war between player and coach, with Ronaldo misbehaving many times over the season. For instance, against Tottenham, he refused to be substituted in during the fag end of a game where United was already cruising to a victory. He was seen heading into the tunnel while the game was still on. And in the few opportunities that Ronaldo did get, he played some of the worst football in his career. In the new season, the goals dried up and all of a sudden, Ronaldo looked like a shell of his former self. What did not help was that at the beginning of the season, Manchester United brought in Dutch coach, Erik ten Hag, formerly of Ajax FC and a tactical savant who has made a name for himself in Europe. Ten Hag is a “project manager” – he was brought in to execute a long-term plan to take Manchester United back to the top of English football. Unfortunately for Ronaldo, his stature itself was not enough for ten Hag to include him in his plans. He was unceremoniously benched for multiple games. While definitely a step down for him in terms of the quality of football, Ronaldo’s transfer to an Asian club is a momentous occasion for the global game. So when the Piers Morgan interview dropped in November, after the team had already disbanded for the mid-season World Cup in Qatar, many were not surprised. Ronaldo did not hold back, taking potshots at the club’s infrastructure, the owners, and most importantly, the coach. The interview was not well received amongst most United fans and the club, with his remarks on ten Hag (“I do not respect him”) drawing particular criticism. He was soon released by the club, becoming a free agent. This transfer comes on the back of weeks of speculation, dating back to before the World Cup. In November, a bombshell Ronaldo interview with Piers Morgan was released. In it, he criticised his then club, Manchester United, and its manager, Erik ten Hag. Soon after the interview, Ronaldo was released by United, making him a free agent. Ronaldo returned to Manchester United a year ago and scored 18 goals in 30 league games. Despite his personal glory and crucial goals, United finished sixth in the league and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Dani Alves, 40, was detained in January after he was accused of raping a young woman in the bathroom of a Barcelona nightclub late last year. Mendy arrived at Chelsea from Rennes in September in a deal that cost the Premier League club around £22 million. He made his debut for the Blues against Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the EFL Cup as Chelsea lost 5–4 on penalties following a 1–1 draw after 90 minutes. He then made his Premier League debut in a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace on October 3. Given that Chelsea conceded 54 Premier League goals last season, only a few might have seen their transformation with a new man between the posts coming quite this quickly. Lampard's side were struggling to keep clean sheets at the start of this season with Kepa in goal and veteran goalkeeper Willy Cabellero also failed to make things easier for the Blues. However, Mendy's arrival has proven to be an inspiration for Chelsea as the stats show that he has conceded just two goals in nine appearances for the club this season. Despite Mendy's impressive performances against Spurs and Palace, Lampard opted to give Kepa another chance in goal by starting him against Southampton. However, Chelsea drew the game 3-3 and fans called for Mendy to start over Kepa. Since then, Mendy has been Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper and kept six clean sheets in his last seven games. Edouard Mendy's numbers for Chelsea so far:Games: 9Shots on Target Faced: 18Saves: 16Save Percentage: 89%Post shot xG: 5.01Goals Actually Conceded: 2He's out-performing his Post-shot xG by a margin of [3.01] 🔥🙌 pic.twitter.com/piYAGnrn8y Frank Lampard's Chelsea have conceded only one goal in their last 630 minutes of football in all competitions. The Blues seem to have rectified their defensive issues following the arrival of Edouard Mendy in September as the Senegalese shot-stopper replaced the under-fire Kepa Arrizabalaga. Mendy has been superb for Chelsea between the sticks this season, having already kept seven clean sheets in nine appearances. Chelsea kept clean sheets against Sevilla, Man United, Krasnodar, Burnley and Rennes before conceding in a 4-1 win over Sheffield United prior to the November international break. However, the Blues returned to their ways of shutting the opposition out against Newcastle in a 2-0 win on Saturday. ALSO READ: Jack Grealish Charged With A FOURTH Driving Offence, Villa Skipper Due To Appear In Court Their most recent final being the one against Spain in 2010, in which they lost 0-1. It was a cataclysmic loss for the Dutch side. That final in South Africa was one of its kind, 14 players were handed yellow cards, nine from Netherlands and five from Spain, the most ever in a World Cup game. The 2006 Germany FIFA World Cup was no good, it also witnessed the most sending-offs in a single campaign (28 in 64 matches). Even the yellow cards count stood at 345 – most brutal. In terms of players, Argentina’s Javier Mascherano is the one with most cards (7) in the history of the World Cup. The next day, had his contract with Perugia cancelled for ‘ruining Italian football’ ğŸ˜³ The biggest upset of the knockout stages was produced by South Korea (ranked 40th), when they handed a chastening 2-1 defeat to Italy in the ‘Round of 16’ of the 2002 Korea/Japan World Cup. Netherlands have been the unluckiest of them all. They have reached the final thrice, finished third four times, and reached the semi-finals eight times, but still failed to lift the coveted trophy. In 1954, goals were scored from left, right and centre. In the fifth edition of the World Cup, goals were scored at an average of 5.38 goals per match – in merely 26 matches, an astounding 140 goals were scored. It was a World Cup of goals – most hattricks were attained in it (8). The fewest ever hattricks were recorded in 2006 (0). Since 1954, the per-match goal average has just gone down, the last edition (2018) witnessed a median of just 2.64 goals per match. Whereas, in 2014 it was 2.67. Will it be higher this time? South Africa’s 2010 World Cup’s group stage exit is the worst ever performance by a host. They might have been ruled out of the World Cup early, but they produced the biggest upset in the group stages of the World Cup by overhauling ninth ranked France 2-1 – their FIFA ranking stood at 83rd at that moment. The highest-scoring draw in the World Cup was between England and Belgium in 1954, when they played a pulsating 4-4 draw. A similar score was witnessed in the 1962 World Cup, in between the Soviet Union and Colombia. The Argentine star already has the record of most man of the match awards in the tournament (4), which he attained in the 2014 World Cup, when they reached the finals but woefully lost to Germany 0-1 in the final. ‘Argentina vs Germany’ is also the most played final in the history of the eminent tournament. Anwar El Ghazi converted a penalty for Villa’s second goal against Newcastle, which has slumped to consecutive losses. Neal Maupay latched onto Yves Bissouma’s interception for his second goal in as many games, with Brighton having started with a come-from-behind 2-1 win at Burnley. Maupay was forced out of action at halftime with a suspected shoulder injury. Sadio Mane is the 5️⃣th player to score 50 home goals for Liverpool in the #PL#LIVBUR pic.twitter.com/6IKSktVXye Grealish marked his home debut for City by scoring the second goal in a 5-0 thrashing of Norwich, the heaviest win so far in a league campaign that is just halfway through its second round. Leeds twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with Everton, while Brentford remained unbeaten in its first top-flight campaign since 1947 after drawing 0-0 at Crystal Palace. Much tougher tests await for City, but the way the champions overran Norwich showed they might be starting to find their form after a disappointing start to the season at Tottenham, where they lost 1-0 last weekend. Brighton is the other team with six points after beating Watford 2-0. He might not have scored an uglier goal — a cross from Gabriel Jesus went through a crowd of players, struck a surprised Grealish on the inside of his left leg, and dribbled over the line — but they all count.

Project Perkin Blanc: A forensic report alleging INR260 crore scam ruffles feathers at Delhi Gymkhana Club What a game of football we have seen! Only fitting that it ends as a draw! And with that, we have come to the end of our live coverage of the FIFA World Cup clash between Spain and Germany. We’ll be back tomorrow with more live footballing action. Till then, take care. Germany should be concerned about its fate as it tries to avoid losing three consecutive World Cup games. Prior to Germany's early elimination in 2018, the men's team had not failed to advance out of group stage since 1938. The four-time World Cup champions were upset by Japan 2-1 on Wednesday. Spain and Japan lead Group E with three points each, while Germany and Costa Rica have no points. Germany have struggled to get their foot to the ball so far. Spain, just like they did in their opener, are passing the ball around with vim and vigour. Olmo, who scored in the first game for Spain, has a crack at goal. Neuer dives and deflects the ball. It hits the underside of the bar and bounces away from goal! Germany get lucky! A surprise opening-match loss has Germany headed into its second game seeking an easy victory to avoid a second consecutive early World Cup exit. It was the veteran Jordi Alba, who created that goal from the left flank. He passed the ball into the middle, for Morata to edge ahead of Sule and flick the ball from six yards over Neuer without breaking his stride! The Ecuadorean FA urged its fans yesterday to clean up their act after football's governing body FIFA opened disciplinary proceedings for homophobic slurs during the South Americans' opening World Cup game against Qatar. Ecuador winless in last four World Cup games against European opposition Both teams are in this position after winning their group openers, each by a 2-0 scoreline. Two early Enner Valencia goals in the first half took down host nation Qatar. Meanwhile, the Netherlands left it late against Senegal. Cody Gakpo came through with six minutes remaining, and Davy Klaassen sealed it deep in stoppage time. ""The Ecuadorean Football Federation calls on Ecuador fans accompanying 'the Tri' in Qatar 2022 to avoid all types of offensive, insulting and discriminatory songs,"" it said in a statement. It is Valencia's sixth World Cup goal in five matches It is Valencia's third strike in the ongoing tournament after two against Qatar An entertaining game ends all square in Group A - a result that suits both sides and confirms Qatar's exit from the World Cup, the first team to be eliminated. The draw knocks hosts Qatar out of the World Cup Ecuador players protest as their goal is ruled offside Cody Gakpo has scored or assisted in each of his last 5 games for the Netherlands: Croatia advanced to the last 16 after a 0-0 draw against Belgium, whose group-stage exit will likely usher in the breakup of its talented but underachieving generation of players. The eastern European nation has reached at least the semifinals on each of the two times it has reached the knockout stage. Belgium was eliminated after scoring one goal in three games and failed to live up to its status as the second-ranked team and one of the tournament favorites. Needing a win to be sure of advancing, Belgium produced its best performance of the World Cup and wasted two clear chances that fell to Romelu Lukaku. The halftime substitute struck a shot against the post and failed to control a ball that bounced off his chest. Hakim Ziyech scored for Morocco in the fourth minute after a bad error by Canada goalkeeper Milan Borjan left the winger to shoot the ball into an empty goal. Youssef En-Nesyri added a second in the 23rd. It looked then like Morocco would overrun the Canadians. This has been some vigorous display of attacking football in both the games. Morocco have already taken the first step towards Round of 16 qualification while Croatia came near to getting a penalty that was disallowed due to one player being offiside through VAR. Carassco commits a foul on Croatian player inside the box while a free kick was taken. Despite sitting bottom of Group F with no points, Canada have attempted 30 shots across their two matches, which is 11 more than any other side in Group F.Can they secure their first #FIFAWorldCup win in this match vs. Morocco? pic.twitter.com/RCf7KPmEBk But Nayef Aguerd's own-goal just before halftime made it 2-1 and lifted Canada enough for them to put pressure on Morocco in search of an equaliser for most of the second half. Canada came agonizingly close when a header from captain Atiba Hutchinson, who came on as a second-half substitute, bounced off the crossbar and onto the goal-line. Belgium are OUT of the World Cup â�Œ pic.twitter.com/SGh5MOIdm5 It may sound heartbreaking but that is how it is, Lionel Messi will no more be a Barcelona player in less than 24 hours.

When asked whether they approve of Trump’s policy to allow fewer immigrants in the U.S., people who support National Rally in France, Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany and Sweden Democrats in Sweden are at least 40 percentage points more likely than nonsupporters to express approval. This stark difference between populist supporters and non-populist supporters appears in many European countries and extends to opinions about Trump himself, as well as to his policy of building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. 3 Young people tend to have more positive opinions of the U.S. In most countries surveyed, young people are more likely than their older counterparts to have a favorable view of the U.S. For example, 57% of Russians ages 18 to 29 see the U.S. favorably, compared with only 15% of Russians ages 50 and older. However, in many countries those who are older also tend to be less likely to answer the question. 10 Views of the U.S. president are closely linked with attitudes toward the U.S. itself. Generally speaking, those with more trust in the U.S. president to do what is right in foreign affairs tend to view the U.S. more positively. For example, the two countries with the most confidence in Trump – Israel and the Philippines – are also among the most favorable toward the country he leads. Conversely, in Turkey and Mexico, low confidence in the U.S. president aligns with less positive views of the U.S. However, in almost every country surveyed, views toward the U.S. surpass confidence in the U.S. president, sometimes by wide margins. 7 Fewer people express confidence in Trump than in other world leaders. Of the five world leaders asked about in the survey, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gets the most positive rating, with a median of 46% expressing confidence in her handling of world affairs. Only around three-in-ten express confidence in Trump (29%) – similar to the share who voice confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping (28%). However, the share of people who express no confidence in Trump is higher (64%) than it is for all of the other world leaders asked about. However, Filipinos and Israelis are especially keen on the U.S. president, with 77% and 71% of adults, respectively, expressing confidence in Trump. And about half or more in Kenya, Nigeria, India and Poland have confidence in the U.S. leader. 6 Support for Trump has increased among those on the ideological right. Since 2018, there has been an increase in confidence in Trump among people on the ideological right, mostly in European countries. For example, since 2018, confidence in the U.S. president has increased 22 percentage points among those who place themselves on the right end of the ideological spectrum in Hungary and Spain. However, even among people on the ideological right, support for Trump rarely rises above 50%. 1 Opinions of the U.S. vary substantially across the globe. Among the countries surveyed, positive views of the U.S. are most common in Israel, the Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Ukraine and Lithuania. (The survey was conducted in Ukraine prior to revelations regarding Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.) By comparison, only 39% of Germans and 20% of people in Turkey have a positive opinion of the U.S.2 Views of the U.S. remain relatively positive, despite declining somewhat since the end of the Obama era. Across 24 countries that have been surveyed consistently since 2015 and 2016, a median of 53% of adults have a favorable view of the U.S., slightly below the 64% who had a positive view at the end of the Obama administration. People in these countries are now more likely to have a favorable view of the U.S. than to have confidence in the president – a reversal of the pattern at the end of the Obama administration. Still, the share of people who have confidence in Trump has edged higher in recent years. Across the six policies asked about in the survey, Israelis generally show the most approval, while those in Turkey are among the most skeptical. As has been the case in past surveys by the Center, Trump inspires much less confidence globally than his predecessor, Barack Obama, and he receives more negative marks than other current world leaders, such as Germany’s Angela Merkel. In addition, Trump’s foreign policies are deeply unpopular. Support for Trump and these policies abroad disproportionately comes from people on the ideological right and those who favor right-wing populist parties in Europe. People around the world have differing assessments of the United States and its president, according to a new Pew Research Center study. On one hand, views of the U.S. are favorable across many of the 33 countries we surveyed in 2019. On the other, confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump is low, though not as low as it was shortly after he took office in 2017. Trump’s base remains a potent electoral force. It handed him more votes – some 74 million – than any Republican in history. Fear of antagonizing them was evident when nearly half of Republican House members, fresh off the mob attack that had sent them scuttling for cover in the Capitol basement, endorsed a failed effort to block certification of Biden’s victory. While some Trump supporters have turned away from him since the assault on the Capitol, most appear to be sticking with him. Some 70% of Republicans remain loyal to Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling done in the immediate aftermath of the siege. Many activists say they’re willing to abandon the party for any perceived slight against their leader.  read more Trump’s political strength stemmed, in part, from his ability to pose as a populist champion to tap into white rural and working-class resentment that has been building for years, as the United States became a more multiracial society and their communities felt the brunt of globalization, analysts say. His staunch supporters argue that he served as a corrective to prior administrations of both parties that let down the poor, the working class and rural regions that have struggled in recent decades. That base of support remains large - another likely legacy of the Trump era. Alex Bruesewitz, a conservative activist associated with Stop the Steal, a pro-Trump movement protesting the election results, said the president retains his appeal to working-class voters. “They felt like they were the forgotten men and women. And the president said, ‘You are forgotten no longer’,” Bruesewitz said. Some far-right fringe groups have also flocked to Trump’s banner. Rioters who gathered at the Capitol included some of the more extreme elements of his base, including members of QAnon, who espouse a debunked conspiracy theory that claims Trump is fighting a Democratic cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles and cannibals. Cure.fit said 90% of its cult trainers continued to be with the firm but did not reveal how many people it employs. Trump relies heavily on Twitter to bring his message directly to his 80 million followers on the site, but also has repeatedly accused it and other social media sites of censoring conservatives. But a comeback in the polls by Trump could lift conventional energy companies and tech stocks, which would take an earnings hit from Biden’s proposed tax hikes. Bitcoin's back in the limelight. The original crypto BTC=BTSP had soared around 75% this year as investors bet on its purported inflation-busting qualities and reputation for swift gains. - Biden tax increase might not be so bad for big banks"

Sec. 2.  Removing Barriers to Sharing Threat Information.     (a)  The Federal Government contracts with IT and OT service providers to conduct an array of day-to-day functions on Federal Information Systems.  These service providers, including cloud service providers, have unique access to and insight into cyber threat and incident information on Federal Information Systems.  At the same time, current contract terms or restrictions may limit the sharing of such threat or incident information with executive departments and agencies (agencies) that are responsible for investigating or remediating cyber incidents, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other elements of the Intelligence Community (IC).  Removing these contractual barriers and increasing the sharing of information about such threats, incidents, and risks are necessary steps to accelerating incident deterrence, prevention, and response efforts and to enabling more effective defense of agencies’ systems and of information collected, processed, and maintained by or for the Federal Government.     (b)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement contract requirements and language for contracting with IT and OT service providers and recommend updates to such requirements and language to the FAR Council and other appropriate agencies.  The recommendations shall include descriptions of contractors to be covered by the proposed contract language.      (c)  The recommended contract language and requirements described in subsection (b) of this section shall be designed to ensure that:          (i)    service providers collect and preserve data, information, and reporting relevant to cybersecurity event prevention, detection, response, and investigation on all information systems over which they have control, including systems operated on behalf of agencies, consistent with agencies’ requirements;          (ii)   service providers share such data, information, and reporting, as they relate to cyber incidents or potential incidents relevant to any agency with which they have contracted, directly with such agency and any other agency that the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, deems appropriate, consistent with applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies;          (iii)  service providers collaborate with Federal cybersecurity or investigative agencies in their investigations of and responses to incidents or potential incidents on Federal Information Systems, including by implementing technical capabilities, such as monitoring networks for threats in collaboration with agencies they support, as needed; and          (iv)   service providers share cyber threat and incident information with agencies, doing so, where possible, in industry-recognized formats for incident response and remediation.     (d)  Within 90 days of receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (b) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the proposed contract language and conditions and, as appropriate, shall publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.     (e)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OMB shall take appropriate steps to ensure to the greatest extent possible that service providers share data with agencies, CISA, and the FBI as may be necessary for the Federal Government to respond to cyber threats, incidents, and risks.     (f)  It is the policy of the Federal Government that:          (i)    information and communications technology (ICT) service providers entering into contracts with agencies must promptly report to such agencies when they discover a cyber incident involving a software product or service provided to such agencies or involving a support system for a software product or service provided to such agencies;          (ii)   ICT service providers must also directly report to CISA whenever they report under subsection (f)(i) of this section to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) Agencies, and CISA must centrally collect and manage such information; and           (iii)  reports pertaining to National Security Systems, as defined in section 10(h) of this order, must be received and managed by the appropriate agency as to be determined under subsection (g)(i)(E) of this section.       (g)  To implement the policy set forth in subsection (f) of this section:          (i) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Attorney General, and the Director of OMB, shall recommend to the FAR Council contract language that identifies:              (A)  the nature of cyber incidents that require reporting;              (B)  the types of information regarding cyber incidents that require reporting to facilitate effective cyber incident response and remediation;              (C)  appropriate and effective protections for privacy and civil liberties;              (D)  the time periods within which contractors must report cyber incidents based on a graduated scale of severity, with reporting on the most severe cyber incidents not to exceed 3 days after initial detection;              (E)  National Security Systems reporting requirements; and              (F)  the type of contractors and associated service providers to be covered by the proposed contract language.          (ii)   Within 90 days of receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (g)(i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommendations and publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.          (iii)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall jointly develop procedures for ensuring that cyber incident reports are promptly and appropriately shared among agencies.     (h)  Current cybersecurity requirements for unclassified system contracts are largely implemented through agency-specific policies and regulations, including cloud-service cybersecurity requirements.  Standardizing common cybersecurity contractual requirements across agencies will streamline and improve compliance for vendors and the Federal Government.     (i)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of General Services, shall review agency-specific cybersecurity requirements that currently exist as a matter of law, policy, or contract and recommend to the FAR Council standardized contract language for appropriate cybersecurity requirements.  Such recommendations shall include consideration of the scope of contractors and associated service providers to be covered by the proposed contract language.     (j)  Within 60 days of receiving the recommended contract language developed pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommended contract language and publish for public comment proposed updates to the FAR.     (k)  Following any updates to the FAR made by the FAR Council after the public comment period described in subsection (j) of this section, agencies shall update their agency-specific cybersecurity requirements to remove any requirements that are duplicative of such FAR updates.     (l)  The Director of OMB shall incorporate into the annual budget process a cost analysis of all recommendations developed under this section. Sec. 6.  Standardizing the Federal Government’s Playbook for Responding to Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities and Incidents.       (a)  The cybersecurity vulnerability and incident response procedures currently used to identify, remediate, and recover from vulnerabilities and incidents affecting their systems vary across agencies, hindering the ability of lead agencies to analyze vulnerabilities and incidents more comprehensively across agencies.  Standardized response processes ensure a more coordinated and centralized cataloging of incidents and tracking of agencies’ progress toward successful responses.      (b)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of OMB, the Federal Chief Information Officers Council, and the Federal Chief Information Security Council, and in coordination with the Secretary of Defense acting through the Director of the NSA, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall develop a standard set of operational procedures (playbook) to be used in planning and conducting a cybersecurity vulnerability and incident response activity respecting FCEB Information Systems.  The playbook shall:          (i)    incorporate all appropriate NIST standards;           (ii)   be used by FCEB Agencies; and          (iii)  articulate progress and completion through all phases of an incident response, while allowing flexibility so it may be used in support of various response activities.     (c)  The Director of OMB shall issue guidance on agency use of the playbook.     (d)  Agencies with cybersecurity vulnerability or incident response procedures that deviate from the playbook may use such procedures only after consulting with the Director of OMB and the APNSA and demonstrating that these procedures meet or exceed the standards proposed in the playbook.    (e)  The Director of CISA, in consultation with the Director of the NSA, shall review and update the playbook annually, and provide information to the Director of OMB for incorporation in guidance updates.     (f)  To ensure comprehensiveness of incident response activities and build confidence that unauthorized cyber actors no longer have access to FCEB Information Systems, the playbook shall establish, consistent with applicable law, a requirement that the Director of CISA review and validate FCEB Agencies’ incident response and remediation results upon an agency’s completion of its incident response.  The Director of CISA may recommend use of another agency or a third-party incident response team as appropriate.    (g)  To ensure a common understanding of cyber incidents and the cybersecurity status of an agency, the playbook shall define key terms and use such terms consistently with any statutory definitions of those terms, to the extent practicable, thereby providing a shared lexicon among agencies using the playbook.

Victims: according to industry reporting, Smoke Loader was observed in March 2022 distributing DanaBot payloads that were subsequently used in DDoS attacks against Ukrainian targets.Resources: for more information on Smoke Loader, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on Smoke Loader. Overview: XakNet is a Russian-language cyber group that has been active as early as March 2022. According to open-source reporting, the XakNet Team threatened to target Ukrainian organizations in response to perceived DDoS or other attacks against Russia.[41] According to reporting from industry, on March 31, 2022, XakNet released a statement stating they would work “exclusively for the good of [Russia].” According to industry reporting, the XakNet Team may be working with or associated with Killnet actors, who claimed credit for the DDoS attacks against a U.S. airport (see the Killnet section). After obtaining access, WIZARD SPIDER affiliated actors have relied on various publicly available and otherwise legitimate tools to facilitate earlier stages of the attack lifecycle before deploying Conti ransomware.

Under the mitigation plan of COVID-19, many states are relying upon existing state parity laws to recoup reimbursement for eligible expenses, especially considering the Medicare waivers. Herein, the legislation makes it possible for payers to reimburse providers at parity for visits conducted via telehealth during the coronavirus outbreak. However, will this be the case when the crisis mode of the pandemic subsides? Finally, private health insurance is already sold and regulated at the state level, which substantiate its role at the epicenter of health policy. Payers can decide how telehealth can help them meet their coverage obligations under state regulations.48 In addition to working with in-network providers, some payers have contracted with third-party providers to provide telehealth services to their members.49 The authors believe that state regulation of telehealth services can bring leverage to patients who prefer to see their local health-care providers remotely. Within state borders, telemedicine can expand the geographic area that a doctor and hospital can serve, and patients living in rural areas would not need to travel for routine consultations with primary-care physicians or specialists. The recommendations in the final part of this paper attempt to harmonize what should begin to be the norm around the use of technology in health care. More specifically, when the nation returns to some level of normalcy, how will a health-care environment driven by digitized health services be supported and maintained, especially if there is a shift in presidential leadership? The proposed recommendations offer some framing for the delivery of such services and the role of states—which have been the primary mitigators of local health options in ensuring telehealth’s continuity after the pandemic. Journalists and researchers have begun to explore the increased value of telehealth after COVID-19, suggesting that Congress may look to more utilization versus reimbursement models in making the services more widely available.54 In fact, some have suggested that continued adoption and use of telehealth could help hospitals buffer the losses due to the coronavirus, due in part to the waivers that the federal government has instituted.55 But moving forward, it will be incumbent upon the federal government, associations representing the health-care industry, and the private companies that comprise the health-care sector to amass data on how telehealth was used during the pandemic, identifying the opportunities and blind spots in its use. On the latter point, many doctors were already providing “remote” services via telephone. Going toward some level of permanency, would this constitute an eligible service for people who may not have access to an internet-enabled device or digital health application or tool? As telehealth was operationalized from a “boots on the ground” model during COVID-19, a term familiar among the medical community in times of crises, state and federal legislators should be able to showcase the outcomes to patients, hospitals, and insurance companies as it evolves from “national pilot” to one that is fully utilized by the medical community. Some analysts have called for more methodical and uniform data collection among providers, which may or may not have occurred during an immediate response to the coronavirus. But if the technology is going to be effectively deployed, or if changes are going to be made around its use, it is imperative that a sufficient system for data capture happen now and extend some time after the peak periods of mitigation to determine its effectiveness and potentially make claims to its efficacy going forward. In a report on telemedicine adoption in North Carolina, Katherine Restrepo outlined several potential solutions to telehealth adoption across states.50 One is expanding the number of states that have signed the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, which streamlines the process for physicians applying for licensure in other member states. However, this still limits telehealth practice based on state licensure. Another solution would be a federal law that designates the provider’s location as the location in which care takes place for the purposes of licensure and payment. This would preserve the authority of state medical boards to grant licenses, while allowing physicians to treat patients remotely in other states. The novel coronavirus was an unlikely accelerant for telehealth use in the U.S. The mandatory appeals for social distancing—maintaining six feet between individuals in public places—made technology a useful tool for adherence to these principles. However, governing bodies at the federal and state levels relaxed many of the regulations to fully unleash telehealth during the outbreak—some of which may be returned after this public-health crisis. As mentioned, the federal government and some states expanded the definitions that govern the use of telehealth, including the types of providers who could bill the government for telehealth services, and increased the devices and locations for which a patient could use telemedicine. The federal government and some states recognized out-of-state licenses for the purposes of telehealth. This means that a licensed provider in Virginia would not have to get a separate North Carolina license just to see a patient remotely. In addition to collecting data on telehealth’s use, the current regulations (particularly those that were waived) and the guidance going into COVID-19 will need to be assessed by Congress—before any changes or a return to legacy regulations are made. As has been documented, large gaps in the consistency among the states was present before the outbreak and will still be there absent of legislative fixes at both the state and federal levels. For example, something as basic as defining a telehealth “visit” can differ between states based on geographic and site restrictions. If the U.S. reverts to its long-term memory over the statutes that were in place, the country will likely negate the lessons learned under a deregulatory, streamlined framework over the last few months. Moving forward, more flexibility in telehealth delivery (e.g., the devices used, the methods, etc.) may drive better consistency in the administration of services and support the next wave of innovation in the health-care field. Because federal reimbursement policies are centered on Medicare, they are narrowly construed and have imposed limitations on where telehealth services may take place, both geographically and by facility, and what services are covered. Moreover, each state dictates separate Medicaid policies, creating a patchwork of telehealth laws and regulations across the nation. Over the last few years, states have begun to pass legislation to encourage private payers to reimburse telehealth-delivered services.34 Access to a mock-up of the target system enables an actor to determine the most effective tools and techniques. A cyber actor can leverage resident system utilities, available exploitation tools; or, if necessary, develop or purchase custom tools to affect the control system. Utilities that are already on the system can be used to reconfigure settings and may have powerful troubleshooting capabilities. This joint Cybersecurity Advisory, which builds on previous NSA and CISA guidance to stop malicious ICS activity and reduce OT exposure [1] [2], describes TTPs that malicious actors use to compromise OT/ICS assets. It also recommends mitigations that owners and operators can use to defend their systems. NSA and CISA encourage OT/ICS owners and operators to apply the recommendations in this CSA. Using the intelligence collected about the control system’s design, a cyber actor may procure systems that are similar to the target and configure them as mock-up versions for practice purposes. Nation-state actors can easily obtain most control system equipment. Groups with limited means can still often acquire control systems through willing vendors and secondhand resellers. Many vendor-provided devices maintain these access capabilities as an auxiliary function and may have services that will automatically ‘phone home’ in an attempt to register and update software or firmware. A vendor may also have multiple access points to cover different tasks. We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we’d welcome your feedback. Cyber actors typically follow these steps to plan and execute compromises against critical infrastructure control systems: Fielding and his colleagues have found that the best recipe for improving physical function and avoiding disability is a combination of walking and resistance training. In the NIA-supported research, older adult volunteers participate in small group exercise sessions led by a physical fitness trainer. Several of these studies were conducted at Tufts, but the program has since expanded to nearby Boston-area gyms and community senior centers. The goal isn’t a perfectly chiseled abdomen or achieving exceptional feats of strength. Rather, participants use different types of ankle weights and dumbbells, or adapt exercises as needed to use their own body weight. The value and joy from group exercises is that participants motivate and encourage each other. Once the study is over, they are advised to continue to incorporate exercise into their regular routines. They often want to participate in other studies and become cheerleaders for the program. “As we get older, there are inevitable functional and biological limitations that can cap exercise endurance, maximum strength, and fitness,” said Shiroma. “Some of these limitations can be slowed down through an active lifestyle that includes strength training. However, it is difficult to study these limits in normal day-to-day life. Studies such as the BLSA are special because scientists can test these limits in the clinic. For example, to test strength and endurance, study participants may be asked to walk or run on a treadmill, or climb stairs, for as long as they can comfortably continue. There are also genetic and environmental components to how people respond to physical challenges and exercise.” In the future, Villareal hopes to explore the possibility of larger, longer-term studies to see if the intervention can prolong physical independence and delay the need for nursing home admission. Keep it fun. According to Fielding, “It’s about finding things that people want to do and like to do, not just exercise for exercise’s sake, but something we enjoy. Goal setting is also important. We ask our volunteers to list everyday things they want to be able to keep doing as they grow older, like play with their grandchildren or be able to take laundry up and down the stairs. Lots of things count as exercise: It doesn’t have to be running or going to the gym or riding a stationary bike. It could be dancing, gardening, or housework.” Daixin actors have sought to gain privileged account access through pass the hash. Daixin actors have sought to gain privileged account access through credential dumping. Daixin actors use RDP to move laterally across a network. Daixin Team members have used Ngrok for data exfiltration over web servers. After obtaining access to the victim’s VPN server, Daixin actors move laterally via Secure Shell (SSH) [T1563.001] and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [T1563.002]. Daixin actors have sought to gain privileged account access through credential dumping [T1003] and pass the hash [T1550.002]. The actors have leveraged privileged accounts to gain access to VMware vCenter Server and reset account passwords [T1098] for ESXi servers in the environment. The actors have then used SSH to connect to accessible ESXi servers and deploy ransomware [T1486] on those servers. This joint CSA provides TTPs and IOCs of Daixin actors obtained from FBI threat response activities and third-party reporting. Daixin actors use SSH and RDP to move laterally across a network.

Daixin actors have leveraged privileged accounts to reset account passwords for VMware ESXi servers in the compromised environment. Risk assessments help schools identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities. As of 2019, 30 states address or establish provisions for security, hazard, or risk assessments in schools. Such laws are often paired with the development of EOPs and often specify both the frequency of such assessments and the agencies that must be involved in assessment execution or review. Colorado requires annual inspections to “address the removal of hazards and vandalism and any other barriers to safety and supervision.”40 Other states have instead created tools and technical assistance to support schools in conducting risk assessments. For example, Kentucky recently updated its 2000 law to require schools to conduct a security assessment, create a risk assessment tool, and provide training for school administrators.41 Prior to 1999, most states already had laws or regulations mandating the implementation of practice drills to prepare schools for fire or natural disasters. However, after the Columbine shooting, states incorporated more detailed and prescriptive mandates to expand and enhance practice drill requirements—for example, by requiring a variety of functional drills, such as lockdown, shelter-in-place, and evacuation drills. A ‘marketplace’ will emerge, where students will be able to pick and choose courses from any university, to create unique, personalized schooling ‘menus.’ Handheld devices will start to carry detection technologies that can appraise across the spectrum, allowing NGOs and even private parties to detect and report environmental problems. Kathleen M. Carley, director of the Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, commented, “More people will be able to work remotely, allowing companies access to greater pools of talent, and a possible leveling of pay across cities. There will be an increased understanding of viruses and how to create vaccines and improved technology to support health care. There will be regulation of and self-imposed constraints on social media platforms. “When one thinks about people’s relationship with technology, one is thinking of the group of people that have access to it – unfettered access. If we restrict the view to that group, the new normal will be an enhanced form of what we are living today, where the economy, the education, the human relations and the politics are technologically mediated. Before the COVID-19 crisis, there was already a push by certain sectors of the media-IT corporations to normalize the use of certain technologies where the possibility of individuals’ control is purely theoretical. That push was supported in part by elite universities, academia, due to funding from those corporations or because the ideological shift had already taken place within them. The Indian regulatory regime has been constantly adapting itselfto address the corporate governance issues that have arisen frommisuse of RPTs by Indian companies. The Government, from time totime, has attempted to increase transparency and accountability ofcompanies to its stakeholders. New provisions governing RPTs werebrought in through the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules framedthereunder (the, ""Companies Act""), thatstipulate shareholders' approval for certain RPTs which are notin the ordinary course of business and at arm's length basis.Similarly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (ListingObligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (the,""Listing Regulations"") require theshareholders' approval for material RPTs. It may be reasonable to expect that in the near future, theframework of RPTs under the Companies Act may be harmonised withthat under the Listing Regulations since the former does notadequately capture transactions that are undertaken with seeminglyunrelated parties. With the inclusion of a 'promoter or members of a promotergroup' in the definition of a related party under the ListingRegulations, the WG Report has cured an inadequacy in the earlierdefinition by ensuring that transactions between the listed entityand its promoters comply with the disclosure requirements of theregulatory framework. However, from a practical perspective, thisinclusion may pose administrative and governance challenges for theday-to-day business of a listed entity by making it onerous totrack and identify all the transactions undertaken by promoters ormembers of a promoter group of a listed entity and seeking approvalof the audit committee for undertaking such transactions. All RPTs and subsequent material modifications (materiality ofmodification to be determined basis the materiality policy of thelisted entity) thereto require the Audit Committee's approval,with certain exceptions for RPTs involving listed or wholly ownedsubsidiaries of the listed entity. The changes introduced in the Sixth Amendmentinter-alia include the expansion of the definition of'related party', revision of materiality thresholds ofRPTs, and inclusion of transactions between unlisted subsidiariesand any related party of the listed entity. Such changes arediscussed in further detail in the following sections."

During its march in the evening, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) protested against the JNU administration with regard to violence at the scholarship section Monday – clashes had broken out between students from the outfit and security staff during their protest to demand the release of scholarships and fellowships, which led to injuries on both sides. Their primary demand was that administration apologise to students and staff for the violence. Read more. With billionaire Gautam Adani launching a hostile takeover of NDTV, the Congress on Wednesday alleged that the bid by a company owned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “khaas dost (special friend)” is a brazen move to control and stifle any semblance of an independent media.

However, this time Adityanath has been the face of the BJP campaign of UP Elections 2022.

In the meantime, Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party complimented Yogi’s tirade by taking on him. SP became a force to reckon with. It may not have realised its dream of winning over 300 seats, but inching closer to the halfway mark of its target is no mean achievement. Akhilesh made the UP elections bipolar, and together with BJP freed the state of the Congress that was trending only in two seats.

The victory has put Yogi in a league of leaders who could be Modi’s replacement, if not in 2024, but later on. A surge in the intra-party tussle against their CM is expected, feel party insiders. But they say Yogi will turn 50 in June this year, and does not push too hard when it comes to personal ambitions. “He has a lot of time at hand and a vast agenda to fulfil,” said one of the senior leaders. The state, which has given the maximum number of PMs, has been powered by a double engine of Modi and Yogi since 2017 Yogi’s return is significant for his party’s national ambitions and also a point to ponder over for the top leadership and the party’s CMs who wish for the return. Yogi’s feat is remarkable because he is the only CM in UP under whose leadership a party will be making back-to-back governments, for the first time in the past 37 years. The last was Congress’s governments in 1980s. In another first of sorts, Yogi had the distinction of being a five-term youngest MP. In the 2017 UP Assembly elections, Samajwadi Party had offered 100 seats to the Congress, of which it won only 7. SP won just 54 out of the 298 it had contested. The brutal blow after much hype over Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi’s partnership with Akhilesh was so stark that SP went solo in the 2019 general elections. In the current Bihar elections, RJD conceded 70 seats to Congress, of which the grand old party managed to win just 19. From UP to Bihar, the party has been emerging as a burden on its allies. It is notable here that in 2019 general elections, Congress, under the leadership of the Gandhis, had fielded 67 candidates. Only 1 (Sonia fro Rae Bareli) won, and 63 candidates lost their deposits. In a Pew survey of almost 30,000 Indian adults conducted between late 2019 and early 2020, nearly two-thirds of Hindus say being Hindu is essential to being genuinely Indian. The BJP draws its power from Hindu voters who see being Indian as having a solid relationship and speaking Hindi. In contrast, only 33% of Hindu voters value these aspects of national identity. In addition to cementing Adityanath’s political future, a BJP victory would also boost his popularity. Among BJP leaders, Yogi Adityanath will become the third tallest leader after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah if the BJP wins Uttar Pradesh-and particularly if it holds a decisive majority.

However, none of this really worked, with the airline continuing to bleed money. At the time, then-civil aviation minister Ajit Singh sparked controversy by saying that “privatisation was the only way to save Air India”. The international service was among the first public-private partnerships in India, with the government holding 49 per cent, the Tatas keeping 25 per cent and the public owning the rest. On the brighter side, the successful sale of Air India is bound to make private sector bidders confident and galvanie other disinvestment procedures which have been moving at a snail’s pace. Now that the dust has settled over the government picking the Tata Group as the winning suitor for loss-making state carrier Air India , we decided to speak to people who were familiar with the contours of this complex transaction. FINE, THE TATAS WON! BUT HAS THE SALE SOLVED THE GOVERNMENTS LIABILITIES? WINNING AIR INDIA: POINTS TO PONDER & PLUSES FOR TATAS One of the persons cited above added, “The way I see it, the pilots and engineering crew of Air India are a valuable lot. You need a specific trained manpower who can fly long haul (double aisle planes) and the presence of these employees is a positive.” DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey called the net worth of the airline “deeply, deeply, deeply negative” at around Rs -44,000 crore. Going ahead, it will be interesting to see how much more the Tatas need to pump in to keep the Maharaja soaring. They spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity. Below is an insider’s account on the most high-profile disinvestment deal under the Narendra Modi regime, break down the financial contours and answer a few critical questions. Find safe & high-yielding bonds for your buck. Discover the right bonds meeting your investment amount & investment horizon The conglomerate, which outbid consortia led by SpiceJet founder Ajay Singh, emerged as the front-runner on the reserve price fixed by a panel of government secretaries. The loss-making airline will be finally sold to one of India's biggest business houses with deep financial power, after several attempts in the last two decades. Singh said the government ran a ""transparent and flexible process"" and gave new impetus to India’s disinvestment program. ""I have been an Air India fan all my life and it’s time for the Maharaja to reclaim its position as a leading airline of the world,” he said. Also read: Tata Sons wins bid for Air India: Report The Tatas already have two airlines in its kitty -- Vistara and AirAsia. Even though they are facing losses, Tata as a conglomerate has unmatched financial competence. After the formal announcement, Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus, Tata Sons, expressed his happiness on Tatas winning the bid, saying: ""Welcome back, Air India"". ""The Tata group winning the bid for Air India is great news! While admittedly it will take considerable effort to rebuild Air India, it will hopefully provide a very strong market opportunity to the Tata group's presence in the aviation industry,"" he said. Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet, congratulated the Tata Group on winning the bid for Air India and wished it all the success. ""It was my honour and privilege to be shortlisted for bidding for Air India. I am confident that the Tata Group will restore the glory of Air India and make all of India proud. I would also like to congratulate the Government on the successful disinvestment of Air India,"" he said. Tata Group's acquisition of Air India was in the news for the past couple of days. The most interesting part about the Tatas winning the bid for Air India is that the conglomerate - which is one of India's oldest -- had ventured into aviation in 1932 with Tata Airlines, which later on became Air India. After the nationalisation in 1953, Air India went to the government, but the Tatas were at the driving seat for as late as 1977. The deal would make Tata Group the second-largest airline operator in the domestic market with a 26.7 per cent market share and behind the market leader IndiGo, with 57 per cent market share. In the international segment though, Tata Group would emerge as the leader with the largest market share by a long shot. The final Air India sale process started early last year and now has finally come to its fruition. With this, there's now a fresh revival hope for the airline, which has been making losses every year since its merger with Indian Airlines in 2007. The long-awaited Air India divestment is one of the biggest reforms by the Narendra Modi government. Air India privatisation is a glowing testimony to the political will power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in ensuring ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’. Unlocking value through either quick resolution, monetisation, or via sale as in the case of the loss-making Air India, which went back to the Tatas in 2022, the Narendra Modi government has exhibited sound business sense. Air India has come full circle, back into the arms of its founders, the Tatas. A bold and brave move by the Modi government and if done right, the deal could in the long run prove to be bountiful for the new owners too. With Air India and Vistara, the Tata group can now pose a threat to international long-haul aspirations of the likes of IndiGo or the international cargo plans of SpiceJet. The acquisition helps the group leapfrog in the domestic aviation space, ahead of most of its competitors with a market share of 27%-35%, just behind market leader IndiGo (52-58% market share). The country’s tax payers will be better off and government will have the luxury of transferring a loss making asset to a corporate entity that has established credentials in the aviation sector, thereby leading to optimum utilisation of resources. The government will no longer be burdened by a strain on its resources from a thoughtless move 69 years ago by India’s first Prime Minister. With Air India now going back to the Tatas, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has showcased why he is both a welfarist and a straight talking reformist, blending the two roles seamlessly. Sanju Verma is an economist, national spokesperson of the BJP and bestselling author of ‘The Modi Gambit’. The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent the stand of this publication. Air India was founded by industrialist and aviator JRD Tata in 1932 as Tata Airlines. In 1953, when the then government of Jawaharlal Nehru nationalised Air India, JRD fought valiantly against it. However, Nehru, a very bad listener who rarely listened to good advice, went ahead and decided to nationalise it despite the fact that Air India was a solid, profit-making airline in 1953. Don’t forget that Air India is one of the most extensive flight service providers in India, flying to 98 destinations (56 domestic destinations with around 2,712 departures per week and 42 international destinations with around 450 departures per week) as of November 1, 2019. What is worse, Nehru summarily merged a profit-making Air India with a bunch of other loss-making airlines, forming a large and clumsy state corporation that was destined to fail from the start. Former Air India executive director Jitender Bhargava, who is also the author of the book 'Descent of Air India', spoke with Business Today TV on what the Tata takeover of the airline would mean for various stakeholders, including passengers. Edited excerpts by Shagun Walia: What can air passengers expect?  The two aspects that we must focus on are: those who were flying on Air India will have a more reliable airline, consistency in on-board services and ground handling. This will be a big gain for existing passengers. And for those who have not been flying Air India, this means they will have another option. Many young people were not looking at Air India as an option because it was government owned, they had a certain perception of the airline. And this perception will change. So there is a lot for passengers because you will have a quality airline competing with international carriers.  Do you think that India will revisit some of the international bilaterals that we gave away to Gulf airlines and other carriers? Do you expect the policy to change? If you look at the last seven-and-a-half years of PM Modi's regime, they have been very constrained as far as the giving away of bilateral rights to foreign carriers is concerned. They have been wanting Indian carriers to make use of the bilateral rights which are not being used, rather than give them to Gulf carriers or Southeast Asian carriers, which has been the government's policy for the last eight years now.  What unfortunately has happened is that Air India has remained the solitary Indian carrier to be flying to Europe, United States, Australia and Japan etc.  None of the other carriers have even thought about this, barring Vistara in a limited way. The vacuum that has been created was being filled up by the Gulf carriers and the Southeast Asian carriers on the pretext that India did not have enough capacity for flying Indian originating passengers or people coming to India, the large Indian diaspora.  But now, with Tata-owned Air India, what will happen is that it will no longer be a cash-starved airline. Tatas will ensure that it grows. And I expect 20-25 per cent growth under the Tatas because you have a large Indian market in Europe and the United States which India wanted.  And let's not forget it that under the Tatas there will be a qualitative, quantitative improvement in the product quality. And once that is there, the current perception that exists will change and a lot of people will patronize it. What is the ultimate gain? It is that Air India, an Indian carrier, will grow rather than Gulf carriers and Southeast Asian carriers which have been dominating Indian skies.  In terms of the product quality, what can we expect? Do you think Air India will reach at least Air Vistara service levels including for in-flight entertainment for instance or better food?  You have to divide the product into two aspects. Certain aspects can be attended to in a matter of weeks, like the food, the wine, the customer focus by the cabin crew etc. All that they require is to re-engineer the work practices of the cabin crew on board and airport staff. In the past, what unfortunately happened was that a lot of the cabin crew did not have enough motivation coming in because of various issues like salary cuts and everything that was imposed on the staff by the cash-starved airline. So once you treat the staff properly and professionally, you will see them delivering. This is what they can do in the short run.  As far as the quality of the aircraft, aircraft ambience is concerned, it will take time unfortunately as we are in COVID times and full capacity is not being deployed. So they will have a certain amount of aircraft on ground which can be taken up for servicing and improvement. What does this landmark deal mean for the country? People have been thinking that the divestment of Air India will only benefit Air India. They are overlooking the fact that once you have a very strong domestic and international carrier, there will be a lot of competition. And once you have an Indian carrier flying to all parts of the world, there is no reason why India originating traffic will not patronize Air India in preference to foreign carriers. The unfortunate part is, as I said earlier, Air India has a certain perception. People had a certain perception of Air India, which was not very flattering. And Air India also did not dispel that kind of perception as I often said the airline was certainly not as good as it ought to have been. But it was not as bad as it was made out to be. So once you have the long haul product, for example to the United States, you will streamline to fly non-stop to the European destinations. Likewise to Australia and Japan. There is no reason why Tatas will not bring about a sustainable change and it will become the number one choice. And the fortunate part is none of the Indian air carriers fly overseas. Watch Business Today TV's complete interview with Jitender Bhargava here I look forward to Air India emerging as a major player on the international scenario, more on the international scenario than the domestic because IndiGo rules the domestic skies to the extent of 50-55 per cent.   What do you expect the Tatas to do as far their other aviation assets -- Air Vistara and AirAsia -- are concerned? Would they consolidate the operations? I am not privy to what the Tatas are thinking. But I am conscious of this fact that having done due diligence, having taken a decision to bid for Air India, they would have certainly looked at options regarding what they are going to do with the four airlines -- Air India, Air India Express, besides AirAsia and Vistara. Probably the easier part is that in AirAsia they have a commanding ownership and it can be merged with Air India Express faster. But Vistara is a joint (venture) with Singapore Airlines. A strong Air India will also impact Singapore Airlines because currently the latter has a lot of Indian passengers from various cities of India over to a hub in Singapore and then flying out to the United States.  When Air India becomes a carrier that can compete with Singapore Airlines in quality, you already have a quantitative requirement of that number of five destinations served by Air India in the United States. And more frequency will be added, then there will be a threat to everybody, all the carriers of Gulf and South Asia who have adhered to enjoy monopoly only because Air India was weak.   A professional leadership, a professional board, a professional management will contribute enormously to what we can foresee Air India as something that we all (will) be proud of. This is a new chapter in Air India history. We witnessed the descent of Air India till 27 January, 2022. After 28 January we can now expect the ascent of Air India. Can we expect Singapore Airlines, which is already invested in Air Vistara, to perhaps become an investor in AI too?  You see my information is that prior to their bidding for Air India, Tatas had checked up with Singapore Airlines. And they have shown their reluctance for whatever reasons. But I am sure that after six months or a year as Air India takes shape and comes out as a vastly improved product, may be Singapore Airlines may show some interest again.  What about existing AI employees and their future?  It is an ironical situation. On one side, there are some employees blaming the government's ownership for what Air India has currently become. And on the other side, they want that kind of a drawback to be retained because they have been looking at the divestment of Air India from their personal perspective. I state in unequivocal terms that you got to look at it from an Air India perspective.  Air India will improve, which means that they will be assured of a job. Government has stipulated that Tatas have to retain the employees for a period of one year. People can perceive it as a negative thing that looks at what happens to me after a period of one year. But I would certainly say take it up as a challenge. This is the period in which you must deliver the very best. If Tatas want to re-engineer your work practices, please support. Don't try things like you have been doing in the past. The work practices will have to be re-engineered, made more productive, more efficient considering the fact that they all have experience. That's one part.  Second, pilots, aircraft engineers, and cabin crew are the three categories in which recruitment has been taking place from the last ten years. So these professional categories will be needed by Tatas. You can't get them so easily. They are trained pilots. And the positive aspect that we have been looking at is, yes, the current strength of these categories may be 20 per cent more than what Air India currently requires. But it gives Tatas the cushion for expansion without incurring additional money. And the faster they expand the services, particularly to Europe and the United States, the better it is for Air India, and the better it is for Tatas.   And I am not saying it by any imagination that it will make Air India a profitable airline. But the losses will considerably go down once this expansion takes place. Productivity of the employees goes up, both men and machines. I would say the productivity will go up. And then you will find a totally new Air India. And then we all would all be saying that Tatas have turned around Air India. Also Read: Anand Mahindra, Vistara, IndiGo congratulate Tata Group on Air India takeover Air India has finally been handed back to the Tata group after 69 years. Times Now speaks exclusively to the man who made this transfer possible after 7 long decades. Jyotiraditya Scindia lists out the reason for handing over Air India to the Tata group and why did the Civil Aviation Ministry think of it as a profitable deal. Jyotiraditya Scindia states that the transaction was made keeping in mind how the money can be put to better use and bring development in the country.  ""There will be job security for all Air India employees for one year"", the minister said. The government sweetened the deal for Air India buyers, giving them flexibility to decide on the amount of Air India debt they want to absorb. The bids were invited on the enterprise value of the company, which includes debt as well as cash on the company's balance sheet. ""It won't be a very easy task there. Only advantage is they (new Air India owner) are paying the price which they think they can manage. They are not taking the excessive debt accumulated to fund years of losses. We are continuing it as an ongoing concern.... This process has also saved huge amount of taxpayers money going forward,"" Pandey told PTI. Tatas beat the  ₹15,100-crore offer by a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh and the reserve price of  ₹12,906 crore set by the government for the sale of its 100 per cent stake in the loss-making carrier. If Tatas form a strategy correctly, Air India could become a very powerful player in the Indian international market, he noted. Ever since Tata Group has taken over Air India, reports have surfaced that the country's oldest multinational conglomerate might merge the debt-ridden airline with Vistara. Whereas the Tata Group took control of Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express on January 27 after successfully winning the bid for the airlines on October 8 last year. New Delhi: Changing tracks helps. But, not taking the beaten path isn't always helpful. This is the story of two of India's biggest privatisations - Air India and Bharat Petroleum (BPCL). Yet the biggest achievement of circa 2021 was shedding of the taboo that 'family silver' was being sold. Privatisation helps save taxpayers money gained more roots than ever before. Since coming to power in 2014, the NDA government has talked about the sale of PSUs, especially loss-making ones, such as Air India. It sought to pass off the sale of state-run entities, such as HPCL to ONGC, another PSU, as strategic sale, drawing criticism even from the CAG. The tone was set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi early in February making a strong pitch for privatisation of public sector units and fiscal support to sick PSUs puts a burden on the economy and public sector units should not be run just because of legacy. But the biggest disinvestment in India's history is expected in the January-March quarter of 2022 with the country's largest insurer Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) slated to come out with an initial public offer (IPO) and list itself on the bourses. The government currently holds 100 per cent in LIC. The year 2021 was a landmark in many aspects in terms of the government's disinvestment programme, as it saw the first privatisation in 19 years and categorizing government companies as strategic and non-strategic -- making it clear to the private sector that the government will walk the talk when it says that 'government has no business to be in business'. It is now trying to push privatisation as a key reform initiative and has even added state-run banks and a general insurance company to the privatisation list. CRPF trooper from Bihar win hearts with Kashmiri songs ONGC, Indian Oil Corporation and NTPC were the top three profitable PSUs in 2018-19, whereas BSNL, Air India and MTNL incurred highest losses for a third consecutive year, according to a survey tabled in Parliament on Monday. State Trading Corporation of India, MSTC and Chennai Petroleum Corporation which were profit making CPSEs in 2017-18, incurred losses in 2018-19 and also feature among the top ten loss- making firms, the survey found. The top three profit making PSUs including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Indian Oil Corporation and NTPC contributed 15.3 per cent, 9.68 per cent and 6.73 per cent, respectively to the total profit earned by all profitable CPSEs."

Later in 2018 Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Yemen were added to the list.

'Nisarga', which is currently brewing in the Arabian Sea, means nature and was termed by India's neighbouring country -- Bangladesh. The name was accorded in a list formulated by a group of countries. 'It'll take forward idea of non-violence': PM Modi unveils bust of Mahatma Gandhi in Hiroshima Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina jointly inaugurate Petrapole Integrated Check Post, 2016. On April 13, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah claimed that Bangladeshis “infiltrate” into India because they don’t get food back home. Shah’s comments were part of an Anandabazaar Patrika interview, given on the campaign trail in West Bengal, where both the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) are currently running neck-to-neck in state elections, poised for a seemingly dramatic finish on May 2. Even further back on April 11, 2019, referring to illegal migrants from Bangladesh as “termites,” Shah said the BJP would throw them out after coming to power in nationwide elections that year. Bangladesh has always been an important discussion point in the West Bengal elections since Mamata Banerjee-led TMC took power in 2011. West Bengal cover around 2,216 kilometers of border between the two countries. Bangladesh and West Bengal share a vibrant culture, climate, and language. From Bangladesh’s perspective, a BJP win means New Delhi cannot shift blame onto Banerjee for stalling the Teesta water-sharing treaty negotiations. However, Banerjee, recently in a March 7 Siliguri election rally, responded that the central government never engaged the West Bengal administration to renew talks regarding the water-sharing treaty, further highlighting uncertainty over the most enduring discussion point in Bangladesh-India relations. A BJP win in West Bengal in the ongoing state elections could complicate Bangladesh-India relations even further. Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. On the other hand, however, Modi’s recent visit to Dhaka to celebrate Bangladesh’s 50 years of independence couldn’t be more politically poignant and symbolically charged. On the second day of the visit, Modi traveled to the birthplace shrine of Harichand Thakur – the founder of the Matua sect – in Orakandi, Gopalganj, making him the first Indian prime minister to ever do so. The highly political move sought to paint the BJP in a favorable light for the 15 million voters of the politically active Matua community in West Bengal, according to Biswanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University in India. Shah’s April 13 comments only added to a backdrop of threats and abuses hurled at Bangladesh by BJP politicians in the past few years. At a public rally in February at Bongaon, the Indian home minister asserted that even a bird wouldn’t be able to enter India from Bangladesh if the BJP is voted into power in West Bengal. Further back in February last year, Indian Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy claimed that Bangladesh would be half empty if India allowed everyone who entered the country illegally to claim citizenship; his ministry has, however, claimed that illegal trespassing dropped by half to 955 between 2016 and 2019. The current government in India has also conceded they do not have accurate data regarding illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. However, this time around, the BJP has largely focused on painting Bangladesh as negatively as possible to woo Hindu voters in the state. For instance, the recently released BJP election campaign video titled “Didi you do not love us” was dominated by paper cuttings, photographs, and news clips showing reports on minority repression in Bangladesh, police action against Islamic outfits in the country, footage of guerrilla fighters from the Middle East fighting under the banner of the Islamic State, and images of cattle smuggling. In a January 23 program marking the 124th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose – attended by both Banerjee and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – the incumbent West Bengal chief minister left the stage chanting “Joy Bangla, Jai Hind” in protest, as a response to BJP men shouting “Jai Shri Ram” slogans from the audience. BJP’s West Bengal chapter President Dilip Ghosh immediately wrote on his Facebook page, “Honourable (Mamata) is fighting for greater Bangladesh,” with multiple BJP wings referring to “Joy Bangla” as a “Muslim Bengal” slogan.

She told a Bloomberg reporter that she had also used his profile photo. ""I guess not ALL the content moderators were let go? Lol,"" Griffin joked afterward on Mastodon, an alternative social media platform where she set up an account last week. Actor Valerie Bertinelli had similarly appropriated Musk's screen name — posting a series of tweets in support of Democratic candidates on Saturday before switching back to her true name. ""Okey-dokey. I've had fun and I think I made my point,"" she tweeted afterwards. Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of safety and integrity, sought to assuage such concerns in a tweet Friday. He said the company's front-line content moderation staff was the group least affected by the job cuts. The $8 verified accounts are Musk's way of democratizing the service, he claims. On Saturday, a Twitter update for iOS devices listed on Apple's app store said users who ""sign up now"" for the new ""Twitter Blue with verification"" can get the blue check next to their names ""just like the celebrities, companies and politicians you already follow."" The platform's new owner issued the warning after some celebrities changed their Twitter display names — not their account names — and tweeted as 'Elon Musk' in reaction to the billionaire's decision to offer verified accounts to all comers for $8 month as he simultaneously laid off a big chunk of the workforce. If the company were to strip current verified users of blue checks — something that hasn't happened — that could exacerbate disinformation on the platform during Tuesday's midterm elections. Musk tweeted late Friday that there was no choice but to cut jobs ""when the company is losing over $4M/day."" He did not provide details on the daily losses at Twitter and said employees who lost their jobs were offered three months' pay as severance. It said the service would first be available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. However, it was not available Sunday and there was no indication when it would go live. A Twitter employ, Esther Crawford, told The Associated Press it is coming ""soon but it hasn't launched yet."" Like Griffin, some Twitter users have already begun migrating from the platform — Counter Social is another popular alternative — following layoffs that began Friday that reportedly affected about half of Twitter's 7,500-employee workforce. They fear a breakdown of moderation and verification could create a disinformation free-for-all on what has been the internet's main conduit for reliable communications from public agencies and other institutions. Meanwhile, an account pretending to be former US president George W Bush tweeted: “I miss killing Iraqis”. The tweet was shared by another fake account pretending to be former British prime minister Tony Blair. The prank wasn't just immune to impersonation accounts. One account purporting to be the official account for the social media company tweeted a crypto scam that garnered more than 35,000 retweets. Another account impersonating video game developer Nintendo tweeted a picture of its masco Mario flipping his middle finger at Twitter. witter has been beset by a wave of celebrity impersonator accounts following Elon Mask’s new verification system on the social media platform. However, many Twitter users have been using the new Blue subscription service to impersonate celebrities and politicians while seeming to be verified. Twitter Blue is a premium subscription service aimed at elevating quality conversations on Twitter, the company says. Twitter then attempted to tackle this by issuing grey “official badges” to verified accounts such as celebrities, government officials and major companies. However, this option was shortly disabled by Musk, who said “Blue check will be the great leveller.” The new Blue subscription service means Twitter no longer verifies the identity of an account owner who receives a verified badge, making it simple for impostor accounts to pass for legitimate ones. Another user parodying ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter claimed that Josh McDaniels had been fired as head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders. The social media platform yesterday attempted to tackle the issue by issuing grey ‘official badges’ to verified accounts Similarly, an account impersonating Cuban baseball pitcher Aroldis Chapman tweeted that he would remain with the New York Yankees. Hello, and welcome to Protocol Entertainment, your guide to the business of the gaming and media industries. This Thursday, we are exploring how entertainment companies and other brands should respond to the crisis at Twitter. Also: What’s next for OBS Studio, and what if every VR ad looked like the ones in Japan. How should brands respond to Twitter changing hands? It’s a good question, and one that matters a lot to media and entertainment companies as well. After all, Twitter has long been one of the spaces where brands have been able to talk directly to some of their most engaged customers. For answers, I caught up with Myles Worthington via email this week. You can read all about Bailey and OBS Studio on Protocol.com, but a few tidbits about the future of the broadcast tool didn’t make it into the story. This week, Singapore-based YouTuber Lazius Kaye made waves on Twitter for posting a Japanese ad for Meta’s Quest 2 headset. “Love dem or hate dem, you can’t deny this is something that makes people feel excited about VR,” he wrote, and lots of people on Twitter agreed. “[W]e’re finally getting decent VR commercials with the energy it deserves,” one Twitter user responded, while someone else tweeted, “[I]f only Meta Connect looked more like this.” The big question: Mastodon or Mastodon’t? Many people have discovered the federated social media network Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter in recent days. Should brands follow them, or is it too early for that? FIFA goes big on blockchain gaming. No, not the gaming franchise from EA, but the actual international footballing body. FIFA, which will split with EA next year, now plans to launch four blockchain-based games in time for the Qatar World Cup this month. The fast-food brand appears to have taken a bit of a Twitter break this month, and it’s not alone: Usually sassy brand accounts like Wendy’s and Panera have notably dialed down their output on the social network in recent days, apparently waiting to see what Twitter will look like once Musk’s verification and content moderation changes take effect. When I first began working on a story on OBS Studio, an app that is being used by many Twitch and YouTube live streamers to power their broadcasts, I simply wanted to highlight yet another open-source project that’s been essential to a massive and growing trend in online media. You know who still hasn’t commented on Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and everything that has transpired since? Chipotle. Netflix is eyeing sports. The streaming service doesn’t want to bid for expensive sports rights, so it is considering investing in niche sports leagues instead. It was that last part that eventually evolved into its own meme, with Twitter users sharing photos of iconic pop cultural references of islands captioned with the same sentence —  the Catalina Wine Mixer from Stepbrothers, Jurassic Park, and of course, the notoriously disastrous Fyre Festival. What these memes illustrated, however, is that it’s highly possible that perhaps what really annoyed people wasn’t the fact that a rich person went to a private island with their friends during the pandemic, but Kim’s insistence that it was done perfectly safely. At this point, the most surprising aspect of Kim Kardashian’s birthday trip is why any of it is surprising at all. Of course celebrities are still going to do celebrity things, because they can. Despite the fact that California, where the Kardashians live, has advised against all forms of nonessential travel, this doesn’t actually mean anything. Flying, private or otherwise is not against the law. The reaction was predictable: Responses to her original tweet accentuated its tone-deafness in the face of mass suffering. “Wow so fun my family still hasn’t met my six month old baby but I’m glad you’re rich!” tweeted McSweeney’s editor Lucy Huber. “You know what would have felt normal for me, Kim? Not having to say goodbye to my mother over FaceTime as she was dying of COVID. Not hearing her ashes be interred over the goddamned phone so I wouldn’t put my dad and sister at risk.” But, within days of quasi-lockdowns appearing in the US, it became clear that famous people would not, actually, be living anything comparable to average quarantined life. Fashion blogger Arielle Charnas received so much backlash for escaping her New York City apartment to a rental house in the Hamptons while having tested positive for coronavirus that she turned off comments on her Instagram; TikTok superstars refused to stop hosting massive parties even after the city of Los Angeles cut off their power. I’m reminded of a recent essay by the New Yorker’s Katy Waldman, who criticized this very tendency in popular fiction. “These self-conscious times have furnished us with a new fallacy. Call it the reflexivity trap. This is the implicit, and sometimes explicit, idea that professing awareness of a fault absolves you of that fault — that lip service equals resistance.” Performative allyship (think the black squares on Instagram, social justice slideshows, or “self-protective irony”) are what Waldman is referring to, the subject of many recent conversations around what “counts” as being a good person. Beyond the performative quarantining, too, Kim’s language in her tweet is telling. As Rebecca Alter noted in Vulture, “This display of exorbitant wealth and privilege during a time of record unemployment and disease is made all the more blatantly icky by Kim’s couching it all in the language of gratitude.” We tend to praise this sort of acknowledgement of our own good fortune, particularly among white people who have been taught that by simply reflecting on white privilege that they are doing the real work of dismantling white supremacy. “Rubbing in this our faces is cruel & clueless,” added Food & Wine senior editor Kat Kinsman. Rock legend Peter Frampton even jumped in, writing, “Are you that insensitive you don’t realise this is not what the majority of people during the worst covid spike yet want to hear? People are going to food banks not private islands.” Many others shared a gif of the iconic quote from Keeping Up with the Kardashians, when Kim cries over a lost diamond earring in the ocean and Kourtney quips, “Kim, there’s people that are dying.” (As these things often go, plenty of other commenters lambasted those griping for their “jealousy” and “hate.”) There is an easier solution to this problem: Just don’t post anything to begin with. Even before Kim Kardashian’s birthday, people have expressed frustration with those in their circle who not only are going on vacations but continue to share photos of them. The pandemic has created a stark divide between people who continue their normal social media habits and for those who think that any type of performance of normal life online is an affront to everyone else. It’s one thing when a paparazzi happens to be in the right place at the right time, sneaking a photo of a celebrity in a compromising position like being caught cheating on a partner or committing the mortal sin of having a normal-looking body. But it is almost always more interesting when a celebrity — completely, ignorantly, and willingly — tells on themself. He added that companies like Twitter had too much power, and highlighted the banning of President Donald Trump from the platform as an example of that. At the time, Dorsey was splitting his time between Twitter and his other company, the financial service Square, and the social media company's value was flagging as its competitors' soared. In his Tuesday post, Dorsey said his 'biggest mistake' was choosing to focus Twitter on managing what people were saying instead of letting people manage themselves. Dorsey did not specify which company that was, but he was likely pointing to Elliott Management, which that year bought a majority share in Twitter for $387million under the direction of managing partner Jesse Cohn, who then set about trying to oust Dorsey. The former Twitter CEO's comments come as the new chief twit Elon Musk started releasing internal Twitter files from before his takeover, which showed that the company actively tried to suppress the tweets of many conservative account-holders. Ultimately, Dorsey decided not to move to Africa as the pandemic descended upon the world, and he and Elliott Management reached a deal that would keep him on as CEO of Twitter. Elliott's campaign to take over Twitter was overseen by Cohn who, along with his team, felt Dorsey was not committed to running Twitter and needed to go if their investment was to flourish. 'The biggest mistake I made was continuing to invest in building tools for us to manage the public conversation, versus building tools for the people using Twitter to easily manage it for themselves,' he wrote. 'This burdened the company with too much power, and opened us to significant outside pressure (such as advertising budgets).' That year Dorsey was also talking about plans to relocate to Africa for an extended period, which some pointed to as evidence that his focus was anywhere but at Twitter. 'It will start with a focus of giving cash and equity grants to engineering teams working on social media and private communication protocols, bitcoin, and a web-only mobile OS,' he wrote. An hour or so later, she received a brief email confirming her sacking, but offering no explanation. One of her colleagues, she later learned from gossip on a private WhatsApp group for Twitter staff, had at least managed to land a blow on Musk before the inevitable happened to him. A data expert educated at the London School of Economics, he had run into Musk at Twitter HQ. None of this should have been a surprise to Musk, who has made clear that he believes Twitter, which started out 16 years ago as a forum in which users could more or less say what they liked, was long ago hijacked by Silicon Valley's censorious woke establishment. Ingle told the Mail she recalled one of her Twitter colleagues directly asking Musk if he was Right-wing when he addressed staff in a meeting before buying the company. Musk first publicly mooted buying Twitter after it banned a conservative Christian satirical website, The Babylon Bee, in March this year. The site, a favourite of Musk, had fallen foul of Twitter's vigilant content police, who deemed it was transphobic after it jokingly named a trans woman official in Joe Biden's administration its 'Man of the Year'. She admits there's 'some mismatch' between the increasingly Republican-leaning Musk and socially progressive Twitter staff. And now the regulators are weighing in. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen indicated on Wednesday that Washington was reviewing Musk's purchase of the social media platform. Trump, who as President sometimes made major policy announcements on Twitter, is dragging his feet over whether he'll return — but for Musk's outraged detractors that hardly matters. Musk had left the decision on whether or not to reinstate Trump to Twitter users, who voted by a slim majority of 51.8 per cent to let Trump back on. 'The people have spoken,' he tweeted. Musk later appeared to holster his pistols after saying he'd spoken to Apple boss Tim Cook and 'resolved the misunderstanding' about Twitter being removed from the App Store. Still, his fiery outburst will hardly have reassured the rest of the tech world. On November 19, Musk restored Donald Trump's Twitter account nearly two years after the ex-President had been 'permanently' banned following the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Musk had left the decision on whether or not to reinstate Trump to Twitter users, who voted by a slim majority of 51.8 per cent to let Trump back on The industry leader for online information for tax, accounting and finance professionals.

The airline group is seeking to implement the restructuring plan through a UK court process, according to sources. Lessors claiming to represent 70% of the airplanes and engines leased to the airline group have called the plan “inappropriate and fatally flawed” and pledged to challenge it, according to people familiar with the matter and a letter from a London law firm seen by Reuters. The letter from the law firm further raises the stakes after Reuters reported that the Malaysian airline group had warned lessors that its shareholder, state fund Khazanah, would stop funding the group and force it into a winding down process if restructuring talks were unsuccessful. Some firms in the fast-growing sector have deviated from their main business of offering financing and leasing services to companies, the CBIRC said in a separate explanatory statement. Under a “Plan B” scenario, Khazanah would inject funds into Firefly, an operator of 12 turboprops that is a fully owned subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines’ parent. Before the pandemic hit, Malaysia Airlines had pushed back its order for Boeing Co 737 MAX jets and industry sources said it was considering smaller planes such as Airbus SE A220s or Embraer SA E190s. In the international market, cashed-up Gulf carriers Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways used the heft of their global networks to encroach on lucrative long-haul routes. Budget rival AirAsia X Bhd, now itself in financial trouble, offered discounted fares on routes within Asia. The airline, which has a fleet of 88 planes, leases aircraft from about a dozen leasing companies, including Avolon, Aercap, BBAM, Air Lease and Standard Chartered’s leasing arm. All of them declined to comment, while another lessor SMBC Aviation did not respond to a Reuters query.

Even as the MCD election was underway on Sunday, the AAP and the BJP took a dig at each other – AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urged people to vote for an “honest party” that does not litter the city, while BJP MP Manoj Tiwari accused the AAP of allegedly deleting names from voter lists. After learning about the matter, Ravi said he reached out to the presiding officer in the polling booth who claimed that the said voters are not on his list. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor alleged that recorded messages of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealing people to vote for the AAP were received by lakhs of people on the day of polling. He said it was a violation of model code of conduct and lodged a complaint with the State Election Commission. The party also lodged a complaint against AAP MLA Durgesh Pathak and another party leader Vijendra Garg. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal cast his vote in the MCD polls and had appealed to the public to vote for a party that works for people rather than creating hurdles. “People should vote for the party that’s honest and works. For those who focus on the cleanliness of the city and not those who keep creating hurdles,” he told reporters, PTI reported. Over the past few weeks in the run-up to Sunday’s MCD elections, major political parties tried to outdo each with stickers, flags, and placards for their campaign, but one strategy was common — roping in autorickshaws. Fitted with loudspeakers, the vehicles blared campaign songs and slogans from dawn to dusk. While campaigning for the polls ended on Friday, The Indian Express spoke to a few auto drivers across the city to find out what the job involved. In South Delhi’s Kalkaji, Govind Barman said he showed up for work around 8 am and drove his auto till around 9 pm, even as its speakers broadcasted the chant, “MCD mein bhi Kejriwal.” In his complaint, Delhi BJP's Legal cell co-convener sanket Gupta alleged that both Pathak and Garg violated model code of conduct by campaigning on the night of December 3 which was ""silence period"" before voting. The complaint also cited a viral social media video of the two AAP leaders allegedly campaigning. The party demanded the Election Commission to direct police to register an FIR against Pathak and Garg. (PTI) Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur was among senior BJP leaders who made a pitch for BJP candidates Friday, the last day of campaigning for the MCD polls. Thakur, who campaigned in parts of East Patel Nagar, Naraina, Mangolpuri and Ranjit Nagar, said: “Arvind Kejriwal came to power by talking of politics of change. For them, the meaning of changing politics was to openly give protection to rioters and the corrupt. Today, rioters, corrupt and criminals from Delhi to Punjab have open protection of Kejriwal. These are the same people who did the work of throwing… Delhi into riots on the arrival of the President of US to India. Petrol bombs and stones were recovered from houses of AAP leaders and Kejriwal was saving these rioters, giving them a clean chit.” After casting his vote along with his family at a polling centre in Civil Lines, Kejriwal said, “Today, I went with my whole family and voted to form an honest government in the municipal corporation. Today is a holiday… You all must go and vote with your family. Ask your neighbours and acquaintances also to vote. Together, we will make Delhi clean and beautiful.” (Read More) Over the past few weeks in the run-up to Sunday’s MCD elections, major political parties tried to outdo each with stickers, flags, and placards for their campaign, but one strategy was common — roping in autorickshaws. Fitted with loudspeakers, the vehicles blared campaign songs and slogans from dawn to dusk. While campaigning for the polls ended on Friday, The Indian Express spoke to a few auto drivers across the city to find out what the job involved. #DelhiMCDElection2022 | #Congress and #AAP volunteers line up at the lanes leading to the polling booth in #ShaheenBagh.

This campaign comes ahead of the Assembly elections. He said that people are free to talk about the things they liked and disliked about the work done by the government in their video. They can then share it on their social media or even send it to people they know in the states that are about to go into elections.

ED Arrests Retired IAS Officer For Money Laundering In Disproportionate Assets Case In Uttarakhand New Delhi: Delhi Chief Minister has started a new campaign called ""Ek Mauka Kejriwal Ko"" in which the people of the national capital can upload videos on social media talking about what appeals to them about the Delhi government/Aam Aadami Party (AAP). Hours After Taking Oath, K'taka CM Siddaramaiah Implements 2 Schemes To Help Women, BPL Families Under this campaign, Kejriwal asked people to make videos of the development work done for welfare of the city and people by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and appeal to the people of other states to vote for AAP. Eyeing the upcoming Assembly elections in Punjab, Goa, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched a campaign named ‘Ek Mauka Kejriwal ko’ and urged Delhiites to campaign for their CM and his party. “We are launching a digital campaign named “Ek mauka Mauka AAP ko”. Under this, I request you all to make a video and capture the developments took place in Delhi since AAP took charge and tell how these schemes — free electricity, water, school, mohalla clinic or any other government scheme benefitted you. Post these videos on your social media account — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and forward it on Whatsapp and appeal to all your relatives, friends and other people in the neighbouring states to vote for AAP,” he said. “I request all AAP volunteers to share these videos as much you can and make it viral. After I win the elections, I will have dinner with the 50 persons whose video goes viral and reach large number of people. I will have dinner with you at my home after the elections are over. I don’t have crores of money to spend it on campaigning. All I can do is ask you to support me and tell people of others states about the good work done by AAP in Delhi,” the CM said. “Also, WhatsApp your videos to people known to you in these states appealing them to give a chance to Kejriwal,” he said. “After elections, I will meet and have dinner with the creators of such top 50 videos.” Urging Delhiites to help drive his party’s campaign in the poll-bound states, Kejriwal said he does not have “crores of money” to spend on elections as he has worked “very honestly” while being at the helm of affairs in the Delhi government. “Make videos on good works of Delhi government telling how you benefitted, and share them on Twitter, Instagram Facebook, Whatsapp, etc., appealing to people to give one chance to Kejriwal if they want similar good works in their states too,” the AAP national convenor said. Launching the “Ek Mauka Kejriwal Ko” (one chance to Kejriwal) campaign, he also asked the AAP volunteers to ensure maximum sharing of such videos and “make them viral” on social media platforms. Kejriwal promised to meet and dine with the creators of top 50 videos after the elections. Also read: It’s poll season in Punjab & it’s time for same promise: Jobs. Here’s why they can’t keep it New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched a campaign for poll-bound states, asking Delhiites to upload videos of the Delhi government’s ‘good work’ on social media platforms. The AAP is contesting on all seats in the Assembly polls to be held in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Goa and Uttarakhand. He was called a ""terrorist"" by BJP leaders, but Kejriwal hit back saying voters could back the BJP if they thought so or opt for his party if they view him as a son of Delhi. During the election campaign, Kejriwal attacked BJP on several occasions, asking who is their chief ministerial candidate. He was careful, however, to not speak out too clearly on the Shaheen Bagh protests. Notwithstanding the electoral triumph for BJP in the May Lok Sabha polls, the IIT graduate has managed to anchor a campaign that wooed all sections in the city. In February 2006, after resigning as joint commissioner in the Income Tax Department, he became a full-time activist and started another NGO, Public Cause Research Foundation, with his award money as a corpus fund. Battling allegations of being autocratic and unyielding in his politics, Kejriwal resigned soon after, only to bide his time till 2015 when he scripted a stunning win to bag 67 of Delhi's 70 seats. His effort to be seen as a direct challenger to Narendra Modi came a cropper in 2014 when he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi. He tried to make an electoral dent in Punjab and Goa in 2017 but that didn't work either. So Delhi it is for the moment. Will this man with many accomplishments manage to break out of Delhi to extend his political reach to other parts of the country? That's the challenge facing the AAP today. “[The] BJP brings to the notice of the Kejriwal government every year about this serious problem of the Delhiites but every time Mr. Kejriwal tries to escape from his responsibilities by taking the excuse of Punjab,” Mr. Gupta wrote. He asked the Delhi CM to “immediately ban stubble burning in Punjab” so that the people of Delhi can breathe clean air. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, in a letter written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, accused him of remaining silent on the issue of stubble burning in Punjab ever since AAP formed a government in the State. He said that Mr. Kejriwal “repeatedly blamed Punjab for air pollution in Delhi” when his party was not in power, but now he is only busy with “political tourism”. Meanwhile, the Commission for Air Quality Management on Wednesday directed authorities to enforce stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which includes a ban on diesel generators and use of coal and firewood in hotels, restaurants and open eateries, with immediate effect.

Frankly, why would people of Punjab  re-elect an incohesive political set-up like the Congress  that is at war with itself. Worse , the Congress leadership , it seemed, was also not keen on retrieving the state. ”  It was as if the party  high command was only interested in selling party tickets.  Punjab elections  was a multi- crore project for the Gandhis that they implemented through their functionaries– Harish Chaudhary and Ajay Maken.

Another trust in its affidavit stated that GSN has lost interest in the maintenance and upkeep of the Sabarmati Ashram and hence there is no question of involving them into the redevelopment project. Tushar Gandhi, Mohandas Gandhi’s great grandson, has been left red faced after the trusts that own and manage the Sabarmati Ashram aka Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad, sided with the state government and opposed involvement of National Gandhi Smarak Nidhi (GSN). GSN has no legal right over the Gandhi Ashram and its precincts, said Atul Pandya, director of one of the trusts, in its affidavit. The state government further stated in their affidavit that the Gandhi Ashram does not give appropriate information about the whole Ashram as formed by Gandhiji and the ideology propounded by the Father of the Nation. The govt added that it is expected of the petitioner to take pride in the fact that attempts are being made to maintain Gandhiji’s legacy, but instead, the petitioner has just expressed unhappiness for no good reason, it added. However, Tushar filed the PIL, disputing the renovation under a body dominated by government office bearers and employees, claiming that excluding Gandhian trusts will result in the new premises losing the Gandhian ethos. The Gujarat HC dismissed Gandhi’s plea on November 21, 2021. News and opinion website that brings you reports and narrative from a perspective often ignored or suppressed by the mainstream media of India. When questioned whether the state is willing to make Gandhi’s descendant an invitee to the committee overseeing the development, advocate general Kamal Trivedi, appearing for the Gujarat government told the CJ of Gujarat HC, “Certainly this can be done, but he can’t dictate (terms).” On April 25, the state government submitted an affidavit in response to the public interest litigation (PIL). The state government refused that the proposed revamp will lose the essence of simplicity and Gandhian ethos. Tushar Gandhi then moved the Supreme Court opposing the redevelopment of Sabarmati Ashram. In March 2022, the apex court agreed to hear the plea filed by Mahatma Gandhi’s great-grandson and asked the HC to examine the plea and said that it is not going into the merits of the case. The Gujarat state government cleared in High Court on Monday (August 1), that MK Gandhi’s descendant could definitely be made an invitee to the committee overseeing the re-development work of the Sabarmati Ashram but could not dictate terms.

The power of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty is showing diminishing returns, primarily because of the repudiation of the Congress by voters in successive elections since 2014.

Heading a state with the highest Covid-19 tally, Thackeray, who had little administrative experience, has drawn praise for his handling of the pandemic and his regular, forthright communication with the state. Fending off a sustained BJP campaign, he refused to be cowed down by the mess over the Mukesh Ambani house bomb scare-Sachin Waze-Param Bir Singh episode. Of all the three Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies, Thackeray’s Shiv Sena has been the most aggressive against the BJP. His hostility against the BJP stems from the personal targeting of the Thackeray clan. A bench headed by him turned down the Government’s request to set up its own committee to probe allegations of surveillance using Pegasus spyware and instead set up its own panel. In the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, too, a bench presided by him asked the UP government to ensure an impartial probe. His tenure has seen the highest number of women judges in the Supreme Court, with the Collegium clearing three names in one go. Without being confrontationist, he has been able to underline the independence of the apex court. Sharad Pawar has been the pivot around which the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance (MVA) in Maharashtra revolves. He is the only Opposition leader with the ability to act and be the bridge between different anti-BJP parties."

As a Leader of Opposition, he was leading the attack on the Centre and now, as the Congress president, he will take along everybody to fight against the Narendra Modi government,” said Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole. Democrats and some Republicans blamed Trump for inciting the violence on Wednesday. ""I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election,"" Trump said, repeating familiar falsehoods. ""But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order."" He posted another message that called the mob ""great patriots"" who were reacting to an election victory ""viciously stripped away."" Twitter later hid three tweets and locked Trump's account. Trump's failure to rein in his supporters stood in sharp contrast to his attitude last summer when he threatened arrests and the use of force to break up protests against racial inequality. ""Today's violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump,"" Jim Mattis, a former defense secretary under Trump, said in a statement. Yet Trump's rally speech on Wednesday was filled with grievances and voter fraud allegations that have not been backed up with evidence. The chaos in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday unfolded after President Donald Trump spent weeks whipping up his supporters with false allegations of fraud in the Nov. 3 election, culminating in a call to march to the building that represents U.S. democracy. He singled out several Republican lawmakers for criticism, including Senator Mitt Romney and Representative Liz Cheney, while hailing as heroes those who have sided with him to stop the electoral votes from being certified. Protesters fought through police barricades, stormed the building and entered lawmakers' chambers. The certification process was stopped and Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress were evacuated.One civilian was shot dead, Washington police said. As night fell, a Capitol official said the building had been cleared, but outside some way from the grounds, scores of protesters remained, including members of militia and far-right groups. ""Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,"" Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Dec. 20. ""Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!"" By India Today Web Desk: Supporters of US President Donald Trump breached the Capitol building in Washington DC on Wednesday in an attempt to stop the US Congress from ratifying the Electoral College vote that would officially confirm Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump. Trump supporters created chaos that resulted in rioting and violence, forcing world leaders to codemn the ugly scenes. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol building ""domestic terrorists"". In a tweet, Trump attacked his own Vice President saying, ""Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!"" ""The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect the true America. Do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it's disorder,"" Biden went on to add. ""I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,"" former US President George W Bush said in a statement.

Mayor Bowser went on to say that the behaviour of Trump supporters is ""shameful, unpatriotic and above all is unlawful"". 11.30 am: The Republican challenges to election results in Michigan and Nevada have failed in joint congressional session for a lack of support from senators. Stating that overturning the decision of the US electorate would lead to a ""democratic death"" spiral, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell advised Republicans not to oppose the will of the voters. Contrary to Trump's demands, Vice President Mike Pence did not oppose Biden's win. 9.14 am: Reactinf to the rioting and violence at the US Capitol building by unruly Trump supporters, Twitter and Facebook have decided to freeze US President Donald Trump's accounts on their platforms. Trump's attorney general Bill Barr was shown telling investigators the defeated president's claims of fraud involving manipulated voting machines were ""complete nonsense."" This may not be a heavy lift, as the question of Trump's criminality has already been settled in part, by a landmark ruling in March from a federal judge who said it was ""more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the joint session of Congress on January 6."" With no actual prosecutorial powers -- the Justice Department is pursuing a parallel criminal investigation -- the panel sees its job as convicting Trump in the court of public opinion. A minute-by-minute visual breakdown -- much of it composed of new footage -- served as a painful reminder of the mayhem that played out as a mob attempted to disrupt the formal vote by lawmakers to transfer power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.

US Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards also gave an account of the violence, in which she was concussed when she cracked her head on the Capitol steps after being knocked over by the surging mob. Video images capturing the raging anger and violence of the mob ransacking the US Congress provided a vivid and visceral picture of the 2021 insurrection on Capitol Hill. Police officers were seen desperately trying -- and failing -- to keep the crowd at bay as rioters climbed scaffolding, hurled chairs and eventually breached the halls of Congress. There were excerpts of taped interviews with Trump administration and campaign officials who told members of Trump's inner circle there was no justification for overturning the election. ""When lawful action is taking place in a case of corruption, Congress is doing this drama and blocking roads....it shows the party considers its leaders above law,"" BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra said. Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, claimed that the Centre is scared of Gandhi's politics as he is raising issues concerning the public and asked whether he has become a hurdle in the path of Prime Minister Narendra Modi protecting the interests of his ""cronies"". Venugopal said this is nothing but ""political vendetta"" by the Modi government, which is trying to defame the Congress leadership through ""false cases"". The Congress has accused the Centre of targeting opposition leaders by misusing investigative agencies. The BJP hit out at the opposition party, saying it is blocking roads to show its ""leaders are above the law"" and termed the protests ""drama"". ""This entire exercise is illegal, unconstitutional, malicious and an exercise by a prime minister burning in the fire of political vendetta,"" Surjewala told a press conference here. They, however, had contended in the high court that Swamy's plea was ""misconceived and premature"". K C Venugopal and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury were among scores of party leaders detained for violating prohibitory orders outside the heavily barricaded party office on Akbar road. The probe pertains to alleged financial irregularities in Young Indian Private Limited, promoted by the Congress, that owns National Herald. Union minister Anurag Thakur also took a swipe at Rahul Gandhi over his questioning by the ED after the Congress leader criticised prime minister's decision to provide 10 lakh government jobs in the next 18 months. In the final stages of the campaign, a row began over a morphed video wrongly attributed to Dr Joseph. The CPI(M) alleged that Congress was behind the “heinous game”, and a few Congress leaders were arrested for allegedly circulating the video. The Opposition party claimed that the video had come from CPI(M) circles and Satheesan dared the police to arrest those who had uploaded the clip. The campaigning period saw often heated exchanges between the ruling coalition and the Congress, and a host of controversies erupted in the past few weeks. These rows put on the backburner any debate around the SilverLine Project and the government’s development agenda. The first row erupted when the CPI(M) introduced Dr Joseph as its candidate from the premises of a Church-run hospital and in the presence of Catholic priests. This led to the Opposition painting the cardiologist as a “Church candidate” but the Congress, fearing a backlash, did not push ahead with this line of attack. Addressing voters on Friday, Vijayan hit out at the BJP for trying to get Christian votes even though, he alleged, the Sangh Parivar targets the community. He recalled incidents such as the Kandhamal violence of 2008 and the murder of Graham Staines’ family in 1999. “They (BJP) are wolves in sheep’s clothing,” the CM added. The party backed senior politician P C George after he was arrested over an alleged hate speech against Muslims. George, a former legislator of regional Christian party Kerala Congress (M), extended support to the BJP on the last day of campaigning on Sunday and hit out at Vijayan. The state government, he added, put him in jail but had not taken action against those who had allegedly made derogatory remarks about Christians and Hindus. The BJP, which is not expected to pose any substantial challenge to the Left and the Congress, focussed on splitting the Christian vote during the campaign. It labelled both the CPI(M) and the Congress as “anti-Christian” parties that are soft on “Muslim fundamentalism”. Referring to the video controversy, Satheesan said the government was afraid of revealing those who were actually behind the morphed clip. “Why can’t the government find those who uploaded the video? I am sure CPI(M) men were behind it,’’ he alleged. Lashing out at the Congress over the video controversy, Vijayan said, “People will give a fitting reply to the Congress for the malicious campaign.’’ In response, Satheesan accused the CPI(M) and the CM of bargaining with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), which is the political wing of the Popular Front of India, over the past month. “All the ministers of the Vijayan cabinet have been after communal outfits in the constituency. We do not solicit the votes of communal elements. We will win with secular votes,’’ he added. For the Left, victory in the by-poll will take its tally in the 140-member House to 100 and will be interpreted as a mandate for the proposed semi-high-speed SilverLine rail corridor that has received a lot of pushback from the Opposition. For the Congress, it will be an electoral test for its new state leadership led by K Sudhakaran, the current state unit president, and Opposition leader V D Satheesan. It will also provide a broad indication of whether Christian votes are with the party. The community forms around 40 per cent of the electorate in Thrikkakara but in recent times several Christian faces have exited the Congress. The UDF has won the constituency since 2011. Another factor that may affect the poll outcome is the votes of “apolitical” outfit Twenty20, which was floated years ago by garment major KITEX. The outfit has announced a tie-up with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) but the front is not contesting the by-poll. In the 2021 Assembly election, Twenty20 secured 13,800 votes while the AAP had bagged 9,300 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from the Assembly segment, which is a part of the Ernakulam parliamentary seat. Responding to the violence, Sweden has been attacked by Muslim countries, especially the Islamic countries in the Middle East, over the acts of ‘deliberate provocation’ against Muslims by senior political leaders in the country. Saudi Arabia, in a statement, has condemned the act of burning the holy book in Sweden saying, “deliberate abuse of the holy Quran by some extremists in Sweden, and provocation and incitement against Muslims”.

India saw stone-pelting at a Police station in Hubli, Karnataka over an alleged outrage over a social media post. On Sunday, Palestinian extremists threw stones to block Jewish visitors at Temple Mount at a bus near Jerusalem’s Old City. Earlier, Iraq’s foreign ministry summoned Sweden’s charge d’affaires (deputy ambassador), Hakan Rooth over the incident. In a strong condemnation, Iraq said that the incident “bears grave implications on Sweden’s relations with all Muslims.” In Tehran, on Monday, The Foreign Ministry of Iran too condemned the ‘sacrilegious move’ of burning the Quran under the ‘pretext of freedom of speech and with the support of the Swedish police.’ Iran called for immediate and decisive action by the Swedish government to end any desecration of the Holy Quran furthermore. Riots roiled cities across Sweden after Danish anti-immigration party Stram Kurs on April 14 announced to burn a copy of the Quran. On the next day, i.e Friday, nine police officers were injured after a violent mob attacked the police and engaged in arson attacks in the city of Orebro in central Sweden.

On Monday, the Swedish police said 26 police officers and 14 civilians had been injured in the violence and that more than 20 vehicles had been damaged or destroyed. Rasmus Paludan, a Swedish politician has vowed to burn down the Quran again while he is touring the country to gather political support. Agencies monitoring the situation in the capital since the unprecedented violence broke out in northeast Delhi have noticed a trend in which panic is being created in the parts of the city by making bogus calls to police control room. On Sunday evening, the police urged people not to believe in rumours circulating on social media and said they have detained some people for spreading rumours. Amid reports of fresh violence, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had shut the entry and exit gates of Tilak Nagar, Nangloi, Surajmal Stadium, Badarpur, Tughlakabad, Uttam Nagar West and Nawada stations. The stations were later opened. ""All of them turned out to be bogus calls. But panic seem to have gripped the city,"" a senior police officer said. According to him, the panic started at around 7 pm when the police raided a gambling racket at a local market in wet Delhi's Khayala. ""People present there started running, which created panic in the area. Some said that some fired at the police. Some channels even flashed that gamblers threw stones at the police. Both turned out to be fake narratives,"" the officer said. ""Please remember that such activities over the internet leave digital footprints. Instigating a riot can have severe consequences ...And severe criminal liability follows. Please be responsible citizens. Verify from trusted sources before forwarding any message..."" the Special Cell of Delhi Police tweeted.

The violence in northeast Delhi last week left 46 people dead and hundreds injured. ""Some anti-social elements have spread rumours. We received many PCR calls. The situation is completely normal. Police personnel have been deployed everywhere. Don't pay attention to rumours and inform police about it,"" Delhi Police public relations officer MS Randhawa told news agency ANI.

There is a reason the BJP would not let go Tuesday of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge’s off-hand remark talking of Narendra Modi and Ravana in the same breath. Nothing works to rally Gujarat voters behind their former chief minister and current Prime Minister as a personal attack on him. Read more Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has stirred a controversy by throwing ""Ravan"" barb at Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections, with Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel claiming the remark reflects the opposition party's hatred for Gujaratis. Hitting out at the Congress, Patra alleged Kharge was voicing the views of former Congress presidents Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. Personal attacks on Modi started with Sonia Gandhi's ""maut ka saudagar"" (merchant of death) remarks during the 2007 Gujarat assembly polls, he said. (PTI) ""Congress is using inappropriate words. Using inappropriate words isn't a sign of healthy politics. Words used by Congress chief Kharge for PM isn't only his mentality but the result of the entire Congress's mentality,"" he said."

(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by BOOM staff and is published from a syndicated feed.) The post's Hindi caption reads: ""Rahul Gandhi is great, at least he accepted it honestly that no one is a bigger fool in the country than him."" I was not the person who hugged the Prime Minister after a speech. I am not the person who is responsible for making the country Congress-mukt. Rahul Gandhi through his actions is making 'Congress-mukt Bharat'. Now tell me, which party unit the person who made that comment represents. He was OSD to a Prime Minister from another party. I wanted to remain silent but these attacks forced me to speak again. He is a good person but he has no aptitude for politics. We tried to make him a successful leader. His mind and heart are not here in politics. His heart is abroad. It is said that the last straw was the setting up of committees in Jammu and Kashmir without consulting you. How true is it? Only those illiterates, especially those who are doing clerical work, in Congress can level these allegations. One who understands Kashmir will know that I will not get a single vote from the BJP camp. Similarly, BJP will not get a vote from its supporters. So where is the area of convergence? If the Rajya Sabha seat was the case, I would not have been part of the G-23. I got involved when I was the Leader of Opposition and I knew it could create problems. So these are Congress propaganda against me. Congress has sharply attacked you describing that your DNA has been ""Modi-fied"". How true is that? Do you mean to say that no suggestions were accepted? I know Rahul takes the decisions but most of my consultations were with Sonia. Sonia had told Rahul that before taking a final decision, he should ask me. Rahul  didn't ask me. He chose the youngest one in the list as party chief. He discarded older ones despite their experience. He called Vikar Rasool Wani individually and told him that he will be the party chief. Wani was told not to tell or meet anyone. He was in Delhi for one week but did not meet me. And, you want me to run the organisation? General Secretary in-charge Rajni Patil met me ten times and General Secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal met me twice. None of them told me anything about the committees being set up. I had told them not to make Working Presidents. But they went ahead. There was a reason why I told them that because you need to have proper representation. Otherwise, it would have been a problem. We have examples. None of the frontal organisation chiefs are from Kashmir. All are from Jammu city. That is not right. I had told them not to make me campaign committee chairman. I am too senior for the campaign committee in a union territory. That was the worst thing and then I was also in the state Political Affairs Committee. I am already in the PAC under Sonia at the national level. Who is the Chairman there? Tariq Hameed Karra, who joined the party four years ago, was a junior minister from PDP when I was Chief Minister. If this isn’t humiliation, then what is it? There were reports about the fight between the old guard and the young brigade. Was there no attempt to bridge the gap? Congress has reached a stage where whoever be the president, he will just be a scapegoat. Can he win one seat in Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, UP or Bengal. Odisha, Gujarat, or in Kerala without an alliance? The then party president (Rahul) himself lost from Amethi in UP in 2019. Mr. Gandhi does not know anything about Savarkar, he said. “No one will ever tolerate the insult of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Balasaheb. It is not in our blood to do politics in the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji and Balasaheb and then compromise for power,” he said in an apparent reference to his main political rival. “Balasaheb's [Thackeray] ideals were trampled upon and we could not bear it. So we staged an uprising. We did not revolt. We did not think of any loss or profit when we went ahead with Balasaheb's ideals [and revolted against Uddhav]...we took our stand publicly,” said the CM. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on November 16 slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his comments against V.D. Savarkar, saying he has been ""shamelessly lying"" about the freedom fighter. Mr. Shinde said Mr. Gandhi thinks he can challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi with his cross-country march, but the PM has never compromised on the issue of nationalism for power. Taking another dig at Uddhav Thackeray, Mr. Shinde said some people are hesitant in taking the name of warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and calling Bal Thackeray a 'Hinduhriday Samrat'. Referring to Uddhav Thackeray, the CM said when Mr. Fadnavis was the Leader of Opposition (November 2019-June 2022), he had moved a resolution in the Assembly to honour Savarkar, but the then-chief minister and the Speaker had argued that such a step did not fit in House rules. “Rahul Gandhi reads out what someone gives him in writing. These fools do not even know how many years he spent in jail...in what condition he lived,” Mr. Fadnavis said. The Chief Minister said Savarkar maintained that Hindutva meant nationalism and Bal Thackeray showed this to the country and Maharashtra through his actions and termed the two personalities as “Hinduhriday Samrats” (emperors of Hindu hearts). “Savarkar is frequently insulted…. [he is addressed as] Mafiveer [by his critics for his mercy petitions]. We are seeing that a soft stand is being taken against them [those who insult Savarkar],” Mr. Shinde said in an apparent reference to Uddhav Thackeray, who is an ally of the Congress.

And Rahul Gandhi is not on test to prove himself. For once, Rahul Gandhi is asking questions, thereby acknowledging he doesn’t have all the answers. This makes him look humble, especially in contrast to Modi who projects himself as the man with all the answers. He doesn’t have any single PM quality, merely having Gamdhi surname will not make any difference.It seems Rahul have given the contract of image makeup to The Print, good job lage raho Poor Shivam Vij  for Rahul Kanwal , Shweta Singh,Rahul Joshi, Smita prakash  are not journalists and questions like people say chowkidar chor hai, in other she called the PM a chor was not tough for a man known for personal integrity, What did Rajdeep ask Sonia Ji or Ravish ask Rahul Gandhi it was not even an interview, I bet even Shivam will be tongue tied in Mr. Modis presence , today such is his persona Control the narrative?What is the compulsion for Rahul to be in public life in the first place? Its not his calling. Its not the narrative of his life. None of his actions speak of that. The poor guy is forced to stay in politics because of idea and ideals bankrupt congress party. All of us should leave Rahul alone and let him live his simple life like any of us. How in good conscience can the so called “liberal” writers , peddle dynasty? Puppy is not only a dynasty, but a really mediocre one. Am  sorry. My English teacher did this to me. Nothing personal OK? Your title is wrong and could have been differet. Editor and not you?? . The headline is wrong. You did not mean Rahul can do press conferee. You meant  He must not do any LIKE Modi. First Part of the article has some sense, especially in the context of Indian journalists who are generally wooden headed. It is wise for Rahul Gandhi to avoid meaningless interviews. But the second art especially the “The interviewee is on test” is an arrogant assertion that can come only from poor and immature journalist. But interestingly the second part in a way justifies why RG should never give interviews to the gang to which this author belongs Mr. Vij, be an independent and impartial journalist. Don’t always bat for Congress. Ask your beloved Gandhi’s to give control of Congress to some capable leader as there is no dearth of leaders in Congress party.  Present Gandhi’s don’t know anything about Indian value system as their upbringing is totally different. Also they are not well educated and well read and so their knowledge is very limited. So Congress should encourage capable regional leaders and to begin with first they should get rid of all left leaning advisors. Student in  K.G.  classes are not taught  Macro or growth economics.  It is too much to burden young child s mind.

But this News paper ( i am forgetting its name) should at least have the moral sense to distinguish between the only STATESMAN politician and PM Bharat has seen.2.1. Sure, this man of humble origins has managed to attract the allegiance of the intellectual , patriotic elite of India like me, though his honesty , enterprise and NATION FIRST POLICY unlike the Italians that the fellow who has written this and the so called editor ( i dont know his name either) of this so called news paper are craving, should rule India, continuing the run of the Dynasty thrust on Bharat by some Gandhi.3. I would like to believe that  the Modi Govt has a well thought out strategy to eliminate the internal enemies of Bharat as promised.4. having said this, the intellectual elite of Bharat would definitley have given Modi better ideas in speedier use of LEGITIMATE STATE POWER to eliminate the internal enemies of the Nation in the Opposition and elsewhere.5. I am sure, the so called editor of papers like this and the fellow who has written this , will also get chance to enjoy life in tihar soon! Worthless article.. This author is just a Pappu devotee. Shame on this author. Should never call himself a journalist . Author has 0 political knowledge, far from genius 😀 Please stop pushing RG and present dynasty.Don’t try to convert brothel into church.. You are telling us about journalism!??! The one who is biased towards a religious faith, without any support of factual evidences?? You all bhakts are blind by your hearts, due to the blindness caused by religious faiths and not due to what is the real world. I am not saying that do not follow a religion or such thing. Even I follow a religion and I adhere to the principles. But following a religion without understanding the reality, is mediocrity. Narendra Modi has been the worst prime minister of history. Even british raj was better than him. And no wonder if he wins the next election due to all of you idiotic bhakts of him. It’s because every time we see Rahul make a speech, it’s in reference to Modi. Modi is this, Modi is that…. But absolutely NO emphasis on what the Congress has been doing. The very existence of Rahul Gandhi has now become dependent on Modi’s criticism- he has no identity left of his own. Thanks for writing this. Defeating Modi and no idea why India should vote for a corrupt, undemocratic and a dictatorial dispensation. What will Indians miss if Congress is out of power is not clear. “It’s hardly an argument that Prime Minister Modi is the most undemocratic leader and refuses to take questions from the media or get rid of his monologues.” It’s hardly an argument that Prime Minister Modi is the most undemocratic leader and refuses to take questions from the media or get rid of his monologues. But this is all the more reason for Rahul Gandhi to stand out and make an effort to distinguish himself from Modi. When has not giving press conferences become the barometer of being undemocratic? The media which keeps cribbing about his lack of media interactions itself isn’t a paragon of domocratic values. We have serious health infrastructure issues at ground level accross the tier 2 cities, towns, villages etc. I don’t understand how engineers like shah, rajnath singh are unable to comprehend this fact. I cannot expect these from Modi as he hails from some different background where he had to prove himself as a person. But, time has come to think and act as Human not as a religious person. We cannot describe India as religious nation. India believes in Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam which Mr. Vajpayee , Rajiv Gandhi etc. used to say. Economic issues are there along with jobs insecurity in all the sectors. There is no focused advance Research and Development wing in  India. We are not talking about jobs based on higher R&D based education. We are talking about how we can open a chai shop and become self-reliant. Higher Education is not a business and money-minded people should understand. We need to create highly qualified and educated scholars not merely the shopkeepers.We have to relinquish the revenge based politics. People have given mandate to serve the people like a servant not as an autocrat. Hitler tried to do the same thing  but he became the curse for the humanity. Please don’t be blind.Pappu has no education nor any experience like his Father Rajiv and people around him are leaving like flies.Congress party is dyeing and no need to give it kiss of life.It is a DYNASTY’ that you are supporting. JAI HIND. I disagree with the author that Rahul Gandhi does not a have a well oiled social media & media machine. Author herself, this Print website, NDTV, India Today, News 24 and many other such mainstream channels are constantly spreading negativity and canards against the PM and BJP. Its just that people do not believe these lies like Rafale. Hence, its just the difference between two leaders (if you can call Rahul Gandhi a leader). There are no flag bearers for Congress. A virtual meeting if planned like Amitbhai Shshji will be a total failure. There will be no Audience. Rahul Gandhi’s Popularity is 0.85% average in India. Who will he address. He does not deserve for that matter none of the Gsndhis/Wadra suit to lead the Indians of 2020. Their Secular Slogan Gone , they are their own liability. Problem with Congress party is it’s run by torika Sonia, Priyanka and Rahul more often than not working at crossroads. Without taking the responsibility of running the party, trying to shoot from behind. It doesn’t matter to him why young capable leaders are leaving the party. Rajan, Abhijit Bajaj not going to help him to get votes. It is high time Rahul Gandhi should keep a low profile.  He should thank his stars that the Home Ministry is not picking up on his dual citizenship.  As per the law, holding another country citizenship, he is not  entitled to contest for the election,  cast his vote and of course cannot hold agricultural property. The Author of the Article says Ra Ga has no well oiled social media ,TV Channels,Press which is  a sheer nonsense statement. Social Medias like The Print,National Herald,The Quint,The Wire,Huffpost India,Firstpost support Ra Ga. Tv Channels like ND TV,India Today,News 24 etc & Press like Deccan Herald,Caravan,The Hindu,Indian Express etc also support him.   Policy of Congress appeasing Minority for votes & after election, leaving them high & dry from last 5 decades, neglecting Hindu sentiments & taking Hindu Votes for granted has labelled Congress as anti-Hindu Party. It requires one more decade till 2030 for Congress to remove tag “anti-Hindu Party” I have made it clear I was not commenting on RaGa’s capability as a possible PM, nor about whether he is the best Congress has. Also, I don’t understand your disclaimer.  I never said or hinted you are working for an organisation. And also I am puzzled about your statement about praying to your God – I made no reference to God about the plight of the country. You suggest – and rightly so – that there is perhaps no credible opposition in India today. You go on to say that neither Shekar Gupta nor the present government can be blamed for that. It is here  that I cannot fully agree with you – the government of the day cannot be blamed for a lack of opposition. Rahul Gandhi is not a graduate of Delhi University ! Mr Ashok: Whilst one can question RaGa’s credentials, one can at the very least, confirm that he has not organised a pogrom. Nor is he associated with fascist organisations like the RSS.  Can that be said about the demonetiser who is now in power ? Why Mr Manoj Sharma ? Because SG does not flatter your Gujarati Messiah ? Alas Mr Ravindra, the history of the world is not written by querying the Ravindra intellect and what is stored in that skull. Indeed, the RSS itself would disagree with you, cf. the speech by your friend the RSS leader Kundan Ranawat. In a speech where the RSS thug places a bounty on the head of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan,  he boasts: Do you think what WP, NYT, Wall Street Journal, The Economist, The Guardian and Independent, BBC, CNN and Jazeera have no impact whatsoever on governments abroad ?  What will they base their perception on ? Perfect. Rahul hasn’t got politics in his blood. All that matters is votes. I find it hard to fathom that erudite men like you refuse to read the writing on the wall when it comes to press freedoms in India. Also read: The Congress strategy on NPR-NRC-CAA has been neither here nor there When the Congress party lost the 2014 Lok Sabha election, it had a mock-introspection in the form of an A.K. Antony panel. This time it didn’t even do that. Any introspection exercise will have to find fault with Rahul Gandhi’s strategies and we don’t do that, we don’t say the prince was wrong. When the Congress party sat on a protest against CAA-NRC at Raj Ghat, V.K. Sreekandan was not present. In case he was, it was not a presence highlighted by the Congress party before the world. Similarly, Anto Antony Punnathaniyil did not address any rally ahead of the Maharashtra assembly election. Not his fault, the Congress party did not ask him to. The Congress did not ask Kodikunnil Suresh to address any rallies in the Haryana assembly election either. The Congress party recently went to the National Human Rights Commission to complain about the state of human rights in Uttar Pradesh. M.K. Raghavan was not part of the delegation. Rajmohan Unnithan was not the main speaker at a Congress rally in Jaipur Tuesday to articulate youth anger against the Narendra Modi government’s economic policies. There were no giant cut-outs of K. Sudhakaran on the rally grounds. The entire Congress party from Jammu to Jamnagar wasn’t tweeting about what K. Muraleedharan said at the rally, because he wasn’t invited to speak. Also read: Even if you take Rahul Gandhi out of politics, the idea of India won’t spring back to life Assam has been protesting against the CAA, and at least four people have died in the state due to police firing. But T.N. Prathapan has not visited Assam. In the recent state assembly elections in Jharkhand, the Congress party held a few rallies. But Adoor Prakash did not address a single one of them. He did not even visit the state. Einstein’s definition of insanity is misquoted (google it!!). And the whole point of the articles is misplaced. What you are asking of Rahul is that he sacrifices himself for a greater cause. Is is big enough to do that? You don’t believe that he is – do you? Congress party seems to be lost in transit as of now. Thanks to Gandhi Scion Rahul Gandhi for his refusal to attain the much needed political maturity. Guha stands in stark contrast to those shielding and protecting the Gandhis from criticism. “Thinking that the cause of Congress’ decline is Rahul Gandhi alone is foolish. The problem is elsewhere. The Congress party needs to be a party of movement rather than ruling. For revival, it should focus on movement mode,” says JNU historian Aditya Mukherjee, typically. With the use of deflecting epithets – “movement mode,” “sacrifice for a cause,” “Hindutva politics,” “caste and communal politics,” and so on, he shields the ruling family of the Congress from honest introspection or criticism. Before Clinton they asked who is Clinton.After his term they ask where is Clinton. Lincoln was assassinated but his family never claimed any benefits nor would they ahve been given any on that count.From where did this man Boris Jhonson come No body knows But he came He will be replaced In due course But here in India this can never happen .Theya re still discussing how Rahul Gandhis skills,looks etc can be improved.What a pity Our colonial rulers have succesfully planted that servilty in our DNA. Why should we worry where one family go ?Allow Sachin Pilots, Scindias , Tharoors to fight it out Results will flow But here’s the rub. Jayen to jayen kahan? Even if they wish to, where would the Gandhis go? Unlike a family firm, which can be sold to a competitor or international buyer, the Gandhis cannot simply exit from the Congress or the country’s politics. Sonia Gandhi and her two children, Rahul and Priyanka, have been reluctant rather than eager politicians. Even Rajiv Gandhi did not show any great inclination to don his mother’s or grandfather’s mantle, being content as an airline pilot till the last decade of his life. Prof Ramachandra Guha is a respected intellectual. However how does he argue in favor of a Gandhi – mukt – Congress? Remember that for over 6-7 decades the definition of a Congressman is ‘Unquestioned obeisance to the first family’.  So when there is no first family , there is no Congressman and thereby no Congress.  What do Prof Guha and Paranjape suggest as the way out of this strange dilemma? Padma Bhushan Ramachandra Guha, is one of India’s leading historians and political commentators but does not understand the ways of political finances. When there is big money and properties created without doing a days honest work, the protection for that comes only by remaining in or on the periphery of power. Once away from that power circle, the legal eagles will start sending their bills for defense in the courts. The life style being enjoyed will come to an end. Isolated leaders have no social circles other than the sycophants who will desert them overnight.While there is a control over the organization, the resources and properties remain under command to keep the sycophants happy and hopeful that one day the power may come back.The definition of status-co is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Where will they go? They have looted so much, have so many fat bank accounts in some countries. They can easily leave for the foreign green haven.Sonia has been telling her family in Italy that she’s the queen of India, so she cannot go back there with a blackened face.Perhaps Switzerland? Vatican City is also an option.As for Ram Guha, he’s a historian without proper knowledge. He knows India from what the British have written about India, but not what the Indians have written about Bharat. The markhands and guhas are not going to decide . Mungerilals. The Congress party and 14 crores of its voters will decide. If ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’ was conceived by no less a historic personage than Mahatma Gandhi and popularised by no less a political heavyweight than PM Modi, to whom should we attribute the idea if not the catchphrase ‘Gandhi-mukt Congress’ – Gandhi-free Congress? The credit should undoubtedly go to Padma Bhushan Ramachandra Guha, one of India’s leading historians and political commentators. What makes Guha’s diatribe against the Gandhi clan even more remarkable is his earlier appeal against its stranglehold on the party: “Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka may think they owe it to the Congress to stay in politics. They owe it to the country to go.” Likening the dynasty to a family-owned company in that op-ed of 25 July in the Hindustan Times, he added, “The longer the Congress remains a Family firm, the easier it will be for Narendra Modi to deflect criticism of his policies and remain not just in power, but in control of the political narrative.” Guha’s courage must be lauded. Unlike the sycophants, who are not merely part of the inner coterie of the Gandhis but are also spread wide and deep in important positions in various walks of life, Guha has called a spade a spade and put his cards on the table, so to speak."

It is untrue that India has not borrowed under the Modi-led government. Viral messages and posts have falsely distorted observations made by former Reserve Bank of India Governor Dr. YV Reddy about India's political economic history in his book 'Advice and Dissent'. The messages misinterpret various sections from the book and string these instances together into a 700-word long tirade against the Congress-led governments of 1980s and 1990s, the Gandhi family and the World Bank. It also falsely states that India has never borrowed from the World Bank under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government. In his book, Reddy outlined his experience with the World Bank and how it handled loan negotiations with India, but did not mention gold pledging with them. Explore and discuss challenges & trends in India's leading B2B events In his memoir, former RBI Governor YV Reddy wrote almost despairingly on bad loans, saying that credit culture is a question of fairness in India; “And that if we do not ensure a sense of fairness, this moral compulsion may be eroded“. The failure to address the basic debt contract will mean, as Urjit Patel said in his book, ‘Overdraft’, that the “living dead borrower"" stays afloat. What it does not mean, however, is that depositors lose their savings. Not a rupee of deposits is lost. What is lost is potential return on the deposits. The cost of borrowing for the honest borrowers that repay loans on time increases, this includes government borrowings, and the interest paid on savings accounts reduces because of the inefficiencies created by loan defaults and consequent write-offs. Progressively, the RBI did tighten these norms. But in India, applying those global norms of recognising a default from day one may not be acceptable or feasible from a political-economy point of view. One, it would mean capital to be set aside, which in turn would mean the owner of most banks in India, the government, stumping up an enormous amount of cash. Besides, of course, lower profits. More importantly, it is also a recognition of ground realities, which is the tortuous process of recovery in India, through mechanism such as negotiations or the insolvency law which appears to have been gamed by promoters and grounded due to judicial delays. But unlike the West, there is no vibrant bond market even now to tap for corporates and other borrowers, making it a predominantly bank loan market in India, thus adding to pressure on local lenders.

Just not justice: Seizure or destruction of property without following due procedure is a troubling misuse of executive power As I explain in my recently released book on restoring financial stability in India, not only is the country not constantly engaged in securing the financial sector’s health to its macroeconomic shores with hoops of steel, it routinely jettisons it for myopic adjustments in government expenditures; the need for such adjustments is accentuated at specific points of the electoral cycle when economic growth must be postured as being high.

I observe with as much pathos that redrawing boundaries of fiscal and bank accounting won’t improve their fundamental health and prospects. First, the central bank is kept distracted away from achieving its long-term objectives of price stability and financial stability; in turn, runaway inflation and chronically weak bank lending create stagflation (stagnant growth and high inflation), occasionally spooking external sector investors, and worse, at times even bank depositors and market investors in the financial sector. Let’s look at the financial scam that erupted in 2018 involving the private capitalist Nirav Modi [2] and the state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB). This public sector bank had fraudulently granted credit to Nirav Modi. PNB officials issued Letters of Undertaking (LOU) that allowed him to borrow from Antwerp, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Mauritius and Bahrain, without these loans being recorded in the PNB accounts in India owing to genuine manipulations. The amounts were therefore not communicated to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Indian central bankCentral BankThe establishment which in a given State is in charge of issuing bank notes and controlling the volume of currency and credit.

The bank officials who carried out these operations did not communicate the SWIFT codes associated with these transactions carried out abroad. The scam amounted to nearly US$2 billion. [3] The smear campaign against the public banking sector in India overlooks an important lesson from the banking crisis that began in 2007-2008 in the US and Europe: the Indian banking sector was hardly affected by the crisis because banking deregulation had not advanced as much in India as elsewhere, which prevented public banks and, to some extent, private banks, from placing large amounts of their assets in foreign markets, especially the US and European markets. The relative financial protectionism observed by the Indian banking sector protected it from contagion effects. The end result was an unprecedented accumulation of NPAs on the balance sheets of public sector banks. The model of universal banking seems to have failed in the Indian context, where public sector banks have largely financed long-term projects. Since most of the resources of these banks are raised through short-term deposits, such project financing involves unwarranted risks for the sector. Secondly, the fact that heavily indebted private companies can still manage to take out large volumes of new credit from public sector banks indicates a systemic malaise, which former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had termed ’risk-free capitalism’. The magnitude of this phenomenon cannot be minimised as simple aberrations. Moreover, if the accumulated NPAs were to be eventually written off or disappear from bank balance sheets by means of a state-funded bailout via a ’bad bank’ - as has already been proposed - this would amount to gratuitous transfers by the state to private corporations. The question to be asked is: why does the state choose to subsidise private companies rather than undertake these investments itself? In other words, the relationship between the state and the private enterprise sector in India in the post-reform period needs to be critically examined in the light of this experience. However, in recent years, a lot of questions have arisen about the performance of private banks, particularly on governance issues. The CEO of ICICI Bank, Chanda Kochhar, has been fired for extending dubious loans. Yes Bank’s CEO, Rana Kapoor’s term was not extended by the RBI and is now under investigation by various agencies. Lakshmi Vilas Bank faced operational problems and merged with DBS Bank of Singapore. In addition, when the RBI ordered an asset quality review in 2015, many private sector banks, including Yes Bank, were found to be under-reporting NPAs. The former managing director of Axis Bank, Shikha Sharma, was also denied an extension. Why is the government so insistent on privatising public sector banks when the performance of private sector banks is nothing to write home about? Two reasons: private companies, including banks, covet the assets of public sector banks that are up for grabs at derisory prices. Secondly, until the public sector is dismantled and private actors have a monopoly, they fear that they will not be in a position to dictate the market as they wish. Viral Acharya, the Deputy Governor of the RBI, was even more outspoken. He believes that the public sector banks have not only performed poorly, but because of their public character, they have managed to attract a disproportionate share of deposits, including bulk deposits. As he said in an interview with BloombergQuint, “Once you have the name of India, Maharashtra or a state in the name of the bank, the depositor implicitly knows that the bank is very, very safe”. So even public sector banks with poor balanceBalanceEnd of year statement of a company’s assets (what the company possesses) and liabilities (what it owes). In other words, the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used; and the liabilities, about the origins of those funds. sheets and poor performance attract large deposits. The tendency for deposits to migrate to public sector banks has, in his view, two consequences for private actors in the banking sector. First, it keeps the private sector small, since the volume of activity of private banks is limited by their small deposit base. Secondly, private banks cannot risk lending to sectors where risks may be higher or profits lower because they cannot hedge adequately against potential losses in these sectors by investing in both these sectors and those in which profits are more certain and perhaps larger.

Mainstream media outlets in India along with some popular social media accounts have been abuzz with talks about 'civil war' happening in Pakistan. However, experts believe this to be a disinformation campaign that grossly misrepresents an ongoing political crisis in the country. Some less known accounts like The International Herald (@TheIntlHerald) and Dr. APR (@drapr007) also 'reported' violent clashes in Pakistan, with one of the accounts posting an obscure video purportedly showing the supposed 'civil war' in Pakistan. Michael Kugelman, the Deputy Director of the Asia Program and Senior Associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars also tweeted out saying that the reports of civil war in Pakistan were false and part of a disinformation campaign. In response, Pakistani media challenged the narrative by their Indian counterparts by fact checking the claims around a civil war, while social media users had a field day trolling the Indian media with photoshopped images of supposed violence happening in Pakistan. BREAKING : Civil war in Pakistan. Reported clashes between Karachi Police & Pak Army pic.twitter.com/tQsUWPx5pa Indian disinformation accounts are exploiting Pakistan's current political crisis and falsely claiming that the country is now experiencing urban warfare and other serious instability. Dangerous and disturbing; several of these accounts are verified, with large followings. Ugh. BOOM spoke to Karachi-based journalist Muhammad Omer Hayat, who refuted the 'civil war' narrative. ""It is a gross misrepresentation of the political turmoil that is going on currently in the country. There is definitely no civil war here,"" Hayat told BOOM. If the ' news reports' originating in India re troops-police firefights etc in Karachi are an example of the 5th generation warfare we are constantly being warned of, we have nothing to worry about except whatever the consequences of laughing our heads off. Worsening the situation was the arrest of  Captain Muhammad Safdar - the son-in-law of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, along with the 'kidnapping' of Sindh police inspector general Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar last Wednesday, in order to force him to sign an arrest warrant for Opposition leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, a spokesman for Pakistan Peoples Party that currently holds power in the Sindh province. India buzzes with fake news of 'civil war' in Pakistan EU DisinfoLab are an independent NGO ""focused on tackling sophisticated disinformation campaigns targeting the EU, its member states, core institutions, and core values"". Their researchers, who are based in Brussels, believe the network's purpose is to disseminate propaganda against India's neighbour and rival Pakistan. Both countries have long sought to control the narrative against the other. Aglaya's marketing brochure mentioned the ability to ""hamper country level reputations"" and described some of its services as ""Cyber Nukes"". In a 2017 interview with Forbes magazine, a man called Ankur Srivastava claimed he ""only sold to Indian intelligence agencies"". The network was designed primarily to ""discredit Pakistan internationally"" and influence decision-making at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and European Parliament, EU DisinfoLab said. ""If the Indian government is behind the newspaper [EU Chronicle], it is not my problem,"" Mr Mariani, a member of France's far-right National Rally, told the BBC. Mr Nimmo, who is director of investigations at digital monitoring firm Graphika, cited previous examples of privately-run large-scale troll operations. ""Just because they're big, it doesn't necessarily mean they're directly run by the state,"" he said. The EU DisinfoLab report said: ""The actors behind the operation hijacked the names of others, tried to impersonate regular media such as the EU Observer... used the letterhead of the European Parliament, registered websites under avatars with fake phone numbers, provided fake addresses to the United Nations, created publishing companies to print books of the think-tanks they owned. One of the most important findings of the open-source investigation was establishing direct links between the Srivastava Group (SG) and at least 10 UN-accredited NGOs, along with several others, which were used to promote Indian interests and criticise Pakistan internationally. There is no evidence the network is linked to India's government, but it relies heavily on amplifying content produced on fake media outlets with the help of Asian News International (ANI) - India's largest wire service and a key focus of the investigation. ""They used layers of fake media that would quote and republish one another. They used politicians who genuinely wanted to defend women or minority rights to ultimately serve geopolitical interests and gave a platform to far-right politicians when convergent objectives could be reached."" 15. Indian Media Trolled For False Claims Of ‘Civil War’ In Pakistan At the height of the pandemic, news agency IANS published a news report, claiming that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said the coronavirus curve was flattening, after he erroneously read the curve upside down. We found that the claim originated from a Pakistani satire website called The Dependent, and had no link to reality. Read here In October, news outlets News18 and Zee News reported about a ‘civil war’ breaking out in Pakistan to describe a political crisis going on in the country. These rumours were quickly dispelled by experts and residents of Pakistan, which quickly led to a barrage of trolling by social media users. Read here.

TOI, HT, ABP News Fall For Fake Account Impersonating Indrajit Chakraborty The government is increasingly using technology to curtail human rights and stifle freedom of expression online. In February 2021, the Indian government published the Information Technology Rules, which imperil freedom of expression and the right to privacy. These rules empower the government to summarily compel the removal of online content without any judicial oversight. They also jeopardize encryption, which is crucial for ensuring privacy and security online, and routinely used by journalists to protect their sources and themselves from being targeted. The Editors Guild of India said the rules undermined media freedom. Three UN human rights experts have expressed concern that the rules do not conform with international human rights norms. These restrictions on media freedom come amid an escalating crackdown on civil society by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government, which is using sedition, counterterrorism, and national security laws to target and prosecute human rights activists, students, government critics, and peaceful protesters. Journalists from minority groups and those in Jammu and Kashmir are particularly at risk, the groups said. The Pegasus Project found that over 40 Indian journalists appeared on a leaked list of potential targets for surveillance. The Indian government has repeatedly stalled attempts to investigate these allegations. This perpetuates an environment of surveillance impunity that results in a chilling effect on free speech and media freedoms, the groups said. In March 2022, airport authorities in Mumbai prevented Rana Ayyub, a prominent Muslim female journalist and an outspoken critic of the BJP, from flying to London to address a journalism event. The authorities said they did so because of an ongoing investigation into money laundering and tax evasion, allegations Ayyub has denied. Independent United Nations human rights experts have alleged that Indian authorities have harassed Ayyub for years. Government supporters and Hindu nationalist trolls have repeatedly abused and threatened Ayyub on social media. The authorities’ targeting of journalists, coupled with a broader crackdown on dissent, has emboldened Hindu nationalists to threaten, harass, and abuse journalists critical of the Indian government, both online and offline, with impunity, the groups said. (New York) – Indian authorities are increasingly targeting journalists and online critics for their criticism of government policies and practices, including by prosecuting them under counterterrorism and sedition laws, ten human rights organizations said today on World Press Freedom Day. Siddique Kappan, another Muslim journalist, has been in prison since October 2020, when Uttar Pradesh police arrested him on baseless charges of terrorism, sedition, and promoting enmity between groups, among others. At the time of his arrest, Kappan had been on his way from New Delhi to Hathras district in Uttar Pradesh to report on a gang rape and murder case of a young Dalit woman that had sparked nationwide protests. Amid growing restrictions on media freedom, Indian authorities have arrested journalists on spurious terrorism and sedition charges, and have routinely targeted critics and independent news organizations, including raiding their workplaces. Journalists and online critics also risk prosecution under the Information Technology Act and IT Rules of 2021 for content critical of the authorities. Indian authorities have been implicated in using the Israeli-produced spyware Pegasus to target journalists. In addition, the authorities’ frequent internet shutdowns hamper the ability of journalists to do their work, including accessing and disseminating information online. In April 2022, at least five journalists covering an event organized by Hindu nationalist groups in Delhi were attacked. Delhi police subsequently opened a criminal investigation into one of these journalists, Meer Faisal, accusing him of inciting hatred through a tweet, in which he alleged that participants in the event attacked him and a photojournalist because they were Muslim. The Committee to Protect Journalists found that at least 20 female Muslim journalists, including Ayyub, had been listed on a fake “auction” app as “for sale” to humiliate, degrade, and intimidate them. All of these journalists have reported critically on how the BJP government’s policies have affected religious minorities. Many women journalists in India, especially those who are critical of the government, face a growing backlash on social media that has included rape and death threats. The abuses often come from account holders who identify themselves as BJP supporters. Prior to Sehwag's post in Shami's defense, the online mob attacked the Indian stalwart by writing obnoxious comments on the bowler's social media accounts. Several socio-political activists, writers, and workers slammed these online attacks of Islamophobic hate against Shami on social media as soon as the fast bowlers' public shaming gained traction in the trending topics on Twitter. ""The online attack on Mohammad Shami is shocking and we stand by him. He is a champion and Anyone who wears the India cap has India in their hearts far more than any online mob.  With you Shami. Agle match mein dikado jalwa,"" wrote Sehwag in his tweet. Check out Sehwag's tweet here: “It is said that in Pakistan, journalists do not have security and they are facing threats. This is international propaganda,” he said, though he did not give any reply to the questions raised by the opposition members regarding the recent attacks on Matiuallah Jan, Absar Alam and Sajid Toor and a ban on TV anchor Hamid Mir. The minister told the lower house of parliament that recently an “info-lab” was detected through which 845 fake websites had been created that fed fake news against Pakistan to the international media. Through these websites, he said, the Kashmir struggle was being questioned and particularly “sub-nationalism in Balochistan” was being promoted. ISLAMABAD: Expressing concern over the ongoing anti-Pakistan propaganda campaign on social media, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry on Monday said that during the recent protests by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) on the blasphemy issue, more than 300,000 tweets originated from Indian city of Ahmedabad within three-and-a-half minutes. He said that two journalists — ­Aziz Memon and Ajay Malwani — were murdered in PPP-ruled Sindh and there had been no progress in the two cases. The minister said wars in the world were now fought through the victory of one’s narrative. Ironically, no heed was paid to that aspect in past, he regretted. The information minister claimed that there was no threat to journalists in the country and termed such reports a part of the international campaign to defame Pakistan. The minister admitted that the External Publicity Wing (EPW) of his ministry was not performing well and it had failed to project Pakistan’s narrative at the international level over the past 20 years when the country fought a war against terrorism. He, however, held the previous governments’ “weak media policy” as responsible for the state of affairs in the EPW. Besides this, he said, the total allocated budget of the EPW was Rs40.5 million, whereas India was spending Rs21 billion for this purpose. And this, he said, not included the budget of Bollywood which made films against Pakistan. The minister said this in his winding up speech in the National Assembly during a debate on the cut motions moved by the opposition members seeking symbolic reduction in the allocation for the information ministry due to its poor performance. Weeks before presentation of the budget, the opposition leaders, including Leader of the Opposition and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, had repeatedly announced that they would not let the government pass the budget from parliament and do whatever they could to achieve this goal. In Mr Khan’s case, he said, he was shifted from Wazirabad to Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital, Lahore, which was not authorised to issue an officially acceptable medico-legal certificate. He said there were reports that the Punjab government had sent a team of doctors from the public sector Jinnah Hospital Lahore to Shaukat Khanum to complete legal formalities. Reports suggest Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi is caught between ‘the devil and the deep blue sea’ as Mr Khan, who essentially calls the shots for the ruling coalition in Punjab, continues to insist on nominating the army officer in the FIR. Sharing the political dimensions of the issue, the source said CM Elahi was against the ‘logic’ of nominating the senior army officer in the case. The CM and PTI leaders held many meetings on the issue where the former attempted to convince them to drop the name of the army officer, the source added. However, when the security advisory was violated, the police then suggested the security officers of Imran Khan to give access to the police on the container to take control of his security. Yet the security staff refused to allow the armed police to get into the container, where Mr Khan was physically interacting with everyone reaching there and this ‘blatant violation’ had irked the police high-ups. He said the Punjab police chief had taken up this issue with the provincial government in Friday’s meeting of the sub-cabinet committee, where he unveiled that Mr Khan’s private security had violated the advisory issued by the police. He also pointed out several other legal flaws that could create troubles for the investigators in the court of law, saying that when Mr Khan got firearm injury he was first to be shifted to the nearby government hospital for a medico-legal case. The law doesn’t allow the victim to get ‘first’ treatment from a private health facility, because ‘incorrect or incomplete’ medico-legal reports may trigger a pause or delay in legal proceedings, he explained. Regarding the formation of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), the Punjab police were of the opinion it would be premature to form a JIT before even lodging the case. In response to a question about the ‘other shooters’ involved in the armed attack on the container in Wazirabad, the police officer said it would be premature to say anything conclusive as the investigations were yet to be started. A senior police officer told Dawn that a set of blunders had been noticed by the law enforcement agencies while examining the footage of the crime scene recoded by a dozen of CCTV cameras. The biggest of the blunders was the security lapse that must be put on the priority in the starting phase of investigations into the incident, he said. He said the huddle also discussed that a further delay in the registration of a case could spoil all efforts to secure evidence and punish the suspects involved in the armed attack on Mr Khan’s container in Wazirabad."

An analyst, Parsa Ventakteshwar Rao Jr, said: “Since Modi’s party has appropriated patriotism as part of its ideology, it doesn’t miss any chance to link itself with a patriotic occasion. What is left unsaid is that this patriotism is Hindu patriotism.” In some Delhi neighbourhoods, residents’ welfare associations have taken it upon themselves to enforce the flying of the flag. When some residents on a WhatsApp group said it should be left to personal choice because some people did not want to follow Modi’s demands, an association president said: “It has nothing to do with personal choice. It is a matter of national honour and respect.” The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party rules at national as well as at state level in Haryana. Other critics of Narendra Modi’s government said students, shopkeepers, housing associations and companies had been pressured by government supporters to display the flag.

The post's Hindi-language caption translates as, ""Pakistan's flag was waved during Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra (Unite India march). This has become Bharat Todo Yatra (Divide India march) Hindus should boycott Congress."" But the claims are false. The video shows people waving the flag of a political party in the southern Indian state of Kerala, not Pakistan's national flag. According to Gandhi, the trek across the country aims to highlight rampant unemployment, soaring inflation and growing polarisation between India's Hindus and religious minorities under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Below is a comparison of the IUML flag as shown in the misleading Facebook post (left) and a picture of the national flag of Pakistan taken by AFP (right): N Samsudheen, a Kerala Legislative Assembly member for the IUML, also told AFP the flags waved at the march were political party flags, not the flag of Pakistan. Pattambi is a town in the Palakkad district of Kerala. The IUML is the Indian Union Muslim League, a political party in the state. The ""Bharat Jodo Yatra"" was started by Rahul Gandhi -- a leader of the opposition Indian National Congress -- in early September. ""It was the flag of the Indian Union Muslim League, which is a registered party. The procession took place on the main road from Shornur to Pattambi,"" said Samsudheen, who represents the Mannarkkad constituency. And ""Barry C. Schneps"" has become a mythical figure on whom opposition politicians from the center and from the Islamist right can project (not for the first time) their criticisms of Khan as a tool of foreign powers, not least the international Jewish lobby in cahoots with Israel. ""Israel and India are Pakistan's enemies. You [India and Israel] are using their money to make a person [Khan] [the prime minister]. Pakistan is a nuclear power, by making such a person sit on [the chair], they [Pakistan’s genuine regional allies] all become suspicious,"" he claimed. But there’s a shadow over the whole nascent national debate, captured by Pakistani journalist Naila Inayat, in an article with the sarcastic headline: ""Pakistan’s enemy number one is Israel now. India can wait."" The complaint against Khan’s ""Indian and Jewish lobbies"" funding was initially filed by a founding member of the Tehreek-i-Insaaf party, Akbar S. Babar, who became disillusioned by Imran Khan's allegedly corrupt practices. The opaque background to chatter about normalization continues to be used to discredit Imran Khan and his government, especially at a politically volatile time when the opposition is using every weapon in its arsenal to remove Khan from power. The Karachi rally shows that protesting any movement towards Israel is itself a potent rallying cry. Pakistan's opposition hosts Hamas at mass rallies against a 'Jewish-Indian plot': Illegal funding for Prime Minister Imran Khan's army-backed party, in exchange for normalizing relations with Israel. It’s a potent rallying cry Taking up the Israel funding theme was senior Islamist politician Rehman, one of the co-heads of the anti-Khan coalition, known as the Pakistan Democratic Movement, which organized the protest. The opposition‘s aim is to undermine any faith in the government’s words, and to expose what is calls its double-dealing. The Israel issue is a perfect fit: it chimes with a long tradition of extreme suspicion towards Israel and ""Jewish funding"" (Khan got flak for meeting George Soros last year), Palestinian rights is a genuinely popular issue, and the trust deficit can be endlessly played on. The issue of Pakistan-Israel relations is the latest battlefield for the tug-of-war between martial law and democracy, ruling party and opposition in Pakistan – and it could still end up an unwitting player in, or casualty of, those high-stakes skirmishes. At a mid-January rally outside the Election Commission of Pakistan, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, daughter and political heir of former prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif, directly accused Khan of taking funds from Israel, calling it part of the ""biggest fraud in Pakistan's history."" Clearly, an altered image is being shared on the internet to falsely suggest that the Indian flag was waved at an anti-government rally in Karachi. A viral image from a protest rally in Pakistan’s Karachi is doing the rounds on social media with a claim that it shows protesters in the crowd waving the Indian tricolour. However, we found that the image was photoshopped to add the Indian flag. [Translation: For 70 years we were taunted using the Pakistani flag. Yesterday, the Indian flag was waved at a rally in Pakistan.] A zoomed in version of the two images suggested that a flag with a flagpole was inserted in the viral image to claim that the Indian tricolour was spotted at the rally."

Leaders of other minority denominations spoke out against the divisive CAA. Prominent among them were the National Council of Churches in India (NCCI) and the Evangelical Fellowship of India (EFI). The NCCI said that the Act polarised communities and contravened the fundamental principles of the Constitution. The EFI expressed concern at the “terrifying impact” of the amendments that threatened to radically change the status of a large number of Indian citizens. In a strongly worded statement, the EFI said: “The breaking of covenants that the Constitution and founding fathers of the nation had made with the people began with Kashmir, took the course of the NRC and the Citizens Amendment Bill (CAB), and now we have the threats to do away with the two seats reserved for Anglo-Indians in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies.” Apart from the Christian minority organisations, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which had supported the Bill in Parliament, had already spoken out against the CAA and the NRC. The protests initially were confined to the north-eastern States when the dubious connection between the CAA and the NRC began to unfold. The BJP tried to play it down as a minor hurdle, assuaging its north-eastern constituents, especially in Assam, that their concerns would be addressed in the legislation. The “minority-majority” binary that the BJP sought to create did not work. The Bill amending the Citizenship Act, 1955, was passed, despite the message that it was a highly socially divisive and sectarian one. But the game plan fell apart as protests spilled over from one State to the other, with widespread participation from all communities, including those that stood to benefit from the sectarian CAA.

Army dogs are in service for around eight years before they are retired. There was an earlier practice of euthanizing Army dogs after they were no longer in active service. An RTI reply in 2015 giving out this information had caused a public uproar following which the policy was amended. In the Indian Army, animals, including dogs, are eligible to be awarded the Chief of Army Staff Commendation Card, Vice Chief of Staff Commendation Card as well as General Officer Commanding in Chief Commendation Card for their acts of gallantry as well as distinguished service. The Dog Handlers are eligible for the gallantry medals and have been awarded Shaurya Chakra and Sena Medal for gallantry while taking part in operations with their dogs. Army dogs are no longer put to permanent sleep. A PIL had also been filed in Delhi High Court in this regard in 2016 where the then Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain had submitted a declaration saying that the policy of euthanizing the animals was being amended and that the dogs will be rehabilitated. Also read: No, the Indian Army does not kill its dogs after retirement What makes the memorial unique is that it is devoted to service animals, mostly dogs, but also horses and mules. It will be the country’s first animal war memorial and recognise heroics on the battlefield, devotion to duty and outstanding contribution to military service alongside soldiers, three senior officers said, asking not to be named. “It will be a befitting token of remembrance and a mark of respect and gratitude towards the RVC soldiers (men and animals) who laid down their lives for the country. Several western nations have memorials dedicated to animals,” said the second officer. “Approval from the defence ministry is expected soon to construct a war memorial to commemorate RVC animals and men who have sacrificed their lives or have been commended for exceptional gallantry or distinguished service. Land has already been identified in Meerut and the preliminary design has been frozen,” said one of the officers. Labradors, German Shepherds and Belgian Shepherds (Malinois) are the mainstay of the army’s canine work force. The RVC has introduced some Mudhol Hounds (an indigenous dog breed from Karnataka) and Cocker Spaniels on a trial basis for explosives detection. Indian Generals may not be battle hardened but they are no fools……….Neither General Bipin Rawat, not any other General will dare utter a single word against China………Their careers &  post retirement perks are  at stake & they know it well !!!

How india expect no reaction if it tries to access to karakuram highway, which is CPEC lifeline.  Dont forget Pakistan already there.  India has to remain like a state not savage, in order to remain a state. I don’t see any issue so long as Chinese are on their side and we are on ours. Any number does not matter and we should match the Chinese man for man and machine for machine. Chinese should know by now that we are there in full strength and any nonsense will be repulsed. While usual military and diplomatic consultations should and must continue, we need to hold on like we did at Dokhlam. Our press should not sensationalize the issue  and follow the Dokhlam type forbearance in reporting. We are sure that Indian Army will handle it well on the ground. Sources told ThePrint that the Chinese have not crossed the CCL in these areas, but did accept that these areas are about 3 km within India’s perception of the LAC. Yeah… very embarrassing that Hindu Modi has to impose curfew to visit Jammu and Kashmir. Your rogue military can only kill unarmed Kashmiris. Chinese forces broke their legs, necks and arms in Ladakh without firing a single shot, by beating them to pulp with nail-studded iron rods. Pakistani forces do not use drone and tanks against own people. But even if they do, at least they are not killing non-Muslims, just you Hindus defend Hindu terror sena for killing Muslim Kashmiris in world’s biggest democracy.

Talking about Kashmir, kindly remember “ethnic cleansing” in post independent India happened in only one place – the Kashmir valley where what you call the poor freedom fighters drove away half a million minority Kashmiri Hindus through violence, threats and rapes in 1990’s and thus removed from Kashmir valley the minorities. No systematic ethnic cleansing happened in any part of post independent India even in a village. These people had not done anything apart from following a religion different from Islam and apparently this was a crime in the eyes of the “poor freedom fighters”. The Indian army was deployed only after this and not before. This is a fact and a matter of record. Tail piece: Don’t give anything to a soldier. Respect him. It costs nothing. He will give you all that he has. Also read: Indian tourists can keep the Chinese away from LAC. Govt must open borders At a second level, the government, in turn, needs to tell the Services what it actually expects from them. For instance, military exercises that envisage a drive deep into Pakistan are never going to happen, not under a nuclear overhang. Do we need to be ready to ‘get back the whole of Kashmir’? No, nobody wants it. Besides, we can’t deal with the slice we have. A rationalisation of tasking helps to pare down the list of acquisition to what you need, versus all those goodies you’re never going to get. The newly created Department of Military Affairs could focus on cutting out the flab in expectations. The numbers will then come down by themselves. If the Army can not be adequately equipped then it should stand down rather than face one sided destruction. You know nothing my dear .Am from secret service ,just stumbled seeing your incomplete truth about India’s modern warfare ecosystem…Just keep in mind you only know what you are shown in media,news channels..We have 5 th generation warfare program which is confidential.So stop scaremongering because you are getting this update from a Defence officer.. However we are planning to showcase these things in expo. First, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence’s hearings over the years are replete with gallant Service officers telling the panel that they would still manage India’s defence no matter what. That’s admirable, but someone, either the Service chiefs or a group of retired senior service officers, need to tell the hard facts to the government. Can we actually fight a two-front war? And as the PSCOD notes, our equipment is not enough for more than 10 days of hard fighting, presumably along one front. These and other ‘ifs and buts’ need to be made clear to the government. Consider the Pentagon reaction to defence cuts under Barack Obama. The 2012 National Defense Strategy said the US’ Department of Defense would make “clear distinctions both among the key sizing and shaping missions… and between these mission areas and all other areas of the defense program”. That was a clear message — as manpower was being reduced, the department could not and would not be able to fulfil everything Congress demanded of it. By all means, tell them what you can do. But also tell them what you can’t."

Mendy arrived at Chelsea from Rennes in September in a deal that cost the Premier League club around £22 million. He made his debut for the Blues against Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the EFL Cup as Chelsea lost 5–4 on penalties following a 1–1 draw after 90 minutes. He then made his Premier League debut in a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace on October 3. Given that Chelsea conceded 54 Premier League goals last season, only a few might have seen their transformation with a new man between the posts coming quite this quickly. Lampard's side were struggling to keep clean sheets at the start of this season with Kepa in goal and veteran goalkeeper Willy Cabellero also failed to make things easier for the Blues. However, Mendy's arrival has proven to be an inspiration for Chelsea as the stats show that he has conceded just two goals in nine appearances for the club this season. Despite Mendy's impressive performances against Spurs and Palace, Lampard opted to give Kepa another chance in goal by starting him against Southampton. However, Chelsea drew the game 3-3 and fans called for Mendy to start over Kepa. Since then, Mendy has been Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper and kept six clean sheets in his last seven games.

Mendy has been superb for Chelsea between the sticks this season, having already kept seven clean sheets in nine appearances.

That final in South Africa was one of its kind, 14 players were handed yellow cards, nine from Netherlands and five from Spain, the most ever in a World Cup game. The 2006 Germany FIFA World Cup was no good, it also witnessed the most sending-offs in a single campaign (28 in 64 matches). Even the yellow cards count stood at 345 – most brutal.

In 1954, goals were scored from left, right and centre. In the fifth edition of the World Cup, goals were scored at an average of 5.38 goals per match – in merely 26 matches, an astounding 140 goals were scored. It was a World Cup of goals – most hattricks were attained in it (8). The fewest ever hattricks were recorded in 2006 (0). Since 1954, the per-match goal average has just gone down, the last edition (2018) witnessed a median of just 2.64 goals per match. Whereas, in 2014 it was 2.67. Will it be higher this time? South Africa’s 2010 World Cup’s group stage exit is the worst ever performance by a host. They might have been ruled out of the World Cup early, but they produced the biggest upset in the group stages of the World Cup by overhauling ninth ranked France 2-1 – their FIFA ranking stood at 83rd at that moment. The highest-scoring draw in the World Cup was between England and Belgium in 1954, when they played a pulsating 4-4 draw.

Germany should be concerned about its fate as it tries to avoid losing three consecutive World Cup games. Prior to Germany's early elimination in 2018, the men's team had not failed to advance out of group stage since 1938. The four-time World Cup champions were upset by Japan 2-1 on Wednesday. Spain and Japan lead Group E with three points each, while Germany and Costa Rica have no points. Germany have struggled to get their foot to the ball so far. Spain, just like they did in their opener, are passing the ball around with vim and vigour. Olmo, who scored in the first game for Spain, has a crack at goal. Neuer dives and deflects the ball. It hits the underside of the bar and bounces away from goal! Germany get lucky! A surprise opening-match loss has Germany headed into its second game seeking an easy victory to avoid a second consecutive early World Cup exit. It was the veteran Jordi Alba, who created that goal from the left flank.

In a Facebook video, he said: “Every five minutes a Russian soldier dies in Ukraine.” After a bungled attempt to overrun Kyiv in the early days of the war, Russia shifted its focus to the region of coal mines and factories. The region has been partly controlled by Russia-backed separatists for years, making supply lines shorter and allowing Moscow to tap separatist forces to back its offensive. But Russia also faces Ukraine's most battle-hardened troops, who have been fighting the separatists for eight years there. (AP) Russia has lost 31, 250 troops since the beginning of its war with Ukraine on February 24, according to estimates published on June 6 by Kyiv Independent. It has also lost 1,386 tanks, 211 planes and 176 helicopters. Canada said on Wednesday it was imposing new sanctions on Russia, banning export of 28 services, such as accounting and advertising, that are needed for the operation of Russian oil, gas and chemical industries.

Russia struck Kyiv with missiles for the first time in more than a month, while President Vladimir Putin warned he would strike new targets in the country if western nations supplied Ukraine with longer-range missiles. In Sievierodonetsk, the main battlefield in the east where Russia has concentrated its forces recently, Ukraine officials said a counter-attack had retaken half of the city. Ukrainian forces pulled back to the outskirts of the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk on Wednesday in the face of a fierce Russian assault, the regional governor said, another big swing in momentum in one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Russia has concentrated its troops and firepower on the small eastern city in recent weeks to secure the surrounding province on behalf of separatist proxies. Ukraine has vowed to fight there for as long as possible, saying the battle could help shape the war's future course."

When asked whether they approve of Trump’s policy to allow fewer immigrants in the U.S., people who support National Rally in France, Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany and Sweden Democrats in Sweden are at least 40 percentage points more likely than nonsupporters to express approval. This stark difference between populist supporters and non-populist supporters appears in many European countries and extends to opinions about Trump himself, as well as to his policy of building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. 3 Young people tend to have more positive opinions of the U.S. In most countries surveyed, young people are more likely than their older counterparts to have a favorable view of the U.S. For example, 57% of Russians ages 18 to 29 see the U.S. favorably, compared with only 15% of Russians ages 50 and older. However, in many countries those who are older also tend to be less likely to answer the question. 10 Views of the U.S. president are closely linked with attitudes toward the U.S. itself. Generally speaking, those with more trust in the U.S. president to do what is right in foreign affairs tend to view the U.S. more positively. For example, the two countries with the most confidence in Trump – Israel and the Philippines – are also among the most favorable toward the country he leads. Conversely, in Turkey and Mexico, low confidence in the U.S. president aligns with less positive views of the U.S. However, in almost every country surveyed, views toward the U.S. surpass confidence in the U.S. president, sometimes by wide margins. 7 Fewer people express confidence in Trump than in other world leaders. Of the five world leaders asked about in the survey, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gets the most positive rating, with a median of 46% expressing confidence in her handling of world affairs. Only around three-in-ten express confidence in Trump (29%) – similar to the share who voice confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping (28%). However, the share of people who express no confidence in Trump is higher (64%) than it is for all of the other world leaders asked about. However, Filipinos and Israelis are especially keen on the U.S. president, with 77% and 71% of adults, respectively, expressing confidence in Trump. And about half or more in Kenya, Nigeria, India and Poland have confidence in the U.S. leader. 6 Support for Trump has increased among those on the ideological right. Since 2018, there has been an increase in confidence in Trump among people on the ideological right, mostly in European countries. For example, since 2018, confidence in the U.S. president has increased 22 percentage points among those who place themselves on the right end of the ideological spectrum in Hungary and Spain. However, even among people on the ideological right, support for Trump rarely rises above 50%. 1 Opinions of the U.S. vary substantially across the globe. Among the countries surveyed, positive views of the U.S. are most common in Israel, the Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Ukraine and Lithuania. (The survey was conducted in Ukraine prior to revelations regarding Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.) By comparison, only 39% of Germans and 20% of people in Turkey have a positive opinion of the U.S.2 Views of the U.S. remain relatively positive, despite declining somewhat since the end of the Obama era. Across 24 countries that have been surveyed consistently since 2015 and 2016, a median of 53% of adults have a favorable view of the U.S., slightly below the 64% who had a positive view at the end of the Obama administration. People in these countries are now more likely to have a favorable view of the U.S. than to have confidence in the president – a reversal of the pattern at the end of the Obama administration. Still, the share of people who have confidence in Trump has edged higher in recent years. Across the six policies asked about in the survey, Israelis generally show the most approval, while those in Turkey are among the most skeptical. As has been the case in past surveys by the Center, Trump inspires much less confidence globally than his predecessor, Barack Obama, and he receives more negative marks than other current world leaders, such as Germany’s Angela Merkel. In addition, Trump’s foreign policies are deeply unpopular. Support for Trump and these policies abroad disproportionately comes from people on the ideological right and those who favor right-wing populist parties in Europe. People around the world have differing assessments of the United States and its president, according to a new Pew Research Center study. On one hand, views of the U.S. are favorable across many of the 33 countries we surveyed in 2019. On the other, confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump is low, though not as low as it was shortly after he took office in 2017. Trump’s base remains a potent electoral force. It handed him more votes – some 74 million – than any Republican in history. Fear of antagonizing them was evident when nearly half of Republican House members, fresh off the mob attack that had sent them scuttling for cover in the Capitol basement, endorsed a failed effort to block certification of Biden’s victory. While some Trump supporters have turned away from him since the assault on the Capitol, most appear to be sticking with him. Some 70% of Republicans remain loyal to Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling done in the immediate aftermath of the siege. Many activists say they’re willing to abandon the party for any perceived slight against their leader.  read more Trump’s political strength stemmed, in part, from his ability to pose as a populist champion to tap into white rural and working-class resentment that has been building for years, as the United States became a more multiracial society and their communities felt the brunt of globalization, analysts say. His staunch supporters argue that he served as a corrective to prior administrations of both parties that let down the poor, the working class and rural regions that have struggled in recent decades. That base of support remains large - another likely legacy of the Trump era. Alex Bruesewitz, a conservative activist associated with Stop the Steal, a pro-Trump movement protesting the election results, said the president retains his appeal to working-class voters. “They felt like they were the forgotten men and women. And the president said, ‘You are forgotten no longer’,” Bruesewitz said. Some far-right fringe groups have also flocked to Trump’s banner.

'It'll take forward idea of non-violence': PM Modi unveils bust of Mahatma Gandhi in Hiroshima Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina jointly inaugurate Petrapole Integrated Check Post, 2016. On April 13, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah claimed that Bangladeshis “infiltrate” into India because they don’t get food back home. Shah’s comments were part of an Anandabazaar Patrika interview, given on the campaign trail in West Bengal, where both the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) are currently running neck-to-neck in state elections, poised for a seemingly dramatic finish on May 2. Even further back on April 11, 2019, referring to illegal migrants from Bangladesh as “termites,” Shah said the BJP would throw them out after coming to power in nationwide elections that year. Bangladesh has always been an important discussion point in the West Bengal elections since Mamata Banerjee-led TMC took power in 2011. West Bengal cover around 2,216 kilometers of border between the two countries. Bangladesh and West Bengal share a vibrant culture, climate, and language. From Bangladesh’s perspective, a BJP win means New Delhi cannot shift blame onto Banerjee for stalling the Teesta water-sharing treaty negotiations. However, Banerjee, recently in a March 7 Siliguri election rally, responded that the central government never engaged the West Bengal administration to renew talks regarding the water-sharing treaty, further highlighting uncertainty over the most enduring discussion point in Bangladesh-India relations. A BJP win in West Bengal in the ongoing state elections could complicate Bangladesh-India relations even further. Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. On the other hand, however, Modi’s recent visit to Dhaka to celebrate Bangladesh’s 50 years of independence couldn’t be more politically poignant and symbolically charged. On the second day of the visit, Modi traveled to the birthplace shrine of Harichand Thakur – the founder of the Matua sect – in Orakandi, Gopalganj, making him the first Indian prime minister to ever do so. The highly political move sought to paint the BJP in a favorable light for the 15 million voters of the politically active Matua community in West Bengal, according to Biswanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University in India. Shah’s April 13 comments only added to a backdrop of threats and abuses hurled at Bangladesh by BJP politicians in the past few years. At a public rally in February at Bongaon, the Indian home minister asserted that even a bird wouldn’t be able to enter India from Bangladesh if the BJP is voted into power in West Bengal. Further back in February last year, Indian Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy claimed that Bangladesh would be half empty if India allowed everyone who entered the country illegally to claim citizenship; his ministry has, however, claimed that illegal trespassing dropped by half to 955 between 2016 and 2019. The current government in India has also conceded they do not have accurate data regarding illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. However, this time around, the BJP has largely focused on painting Bangladesh as negatively as possible to woo Hindu voters in the state. For instance, the recently released BJP election campaign video titled “Didi you do not love us” was dominated by paper cuttings, photographs, and news clips showing reports on minority repression in Bangladesh, police action against Islamic outfits in the country, footage of guerrilla fighters from the Middle East fighting under the banner of the Islamic State, and images of cattle smuggling. In a January 23 program marking the 124th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose – attended by both Banerjee and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – the incumbent West Bengal chief minister left the stage chanting “Joy Bangla, Jai Hind” in protest, as a response to BJP men shouting “Jai Shri Ram” slogans from the audience. BJP’s West Bengal chapter President Dilip Ghosh immediately wrote on his Facebook page, “Honourable (Mamata) is fighting for greater Bangladesh,” with multiple BJP wings referring to “Joy Bangla” as a “Muslim Bengal” slogan. - PM Modi, after W Bengal Gov Jagdeep Dhankhar elected as NDA's VP candidate The Chinese vessel is scheduled to leave the Hambantota port on August 22.

Can a friendly-neighbourhood Mohali fab drive India’s chip plans? Hello, and welcome to Protocol Entertainment, your guide to the business of the gaming and media industries. This Thursday, we are exploring how entertainment companies and other brands should respond to the crisis at Twitter. Also: What’s next for OBS Studio, and what if every VR ad looked like the ones in Japan. How should brands respond to Twitter changing hands? It’s a good question, and one that matters a lot to media and entertainment companies as well. After all, Twitter has long been one of the spaces where brands have been able to talk directly to some of their most engaged customers. For answers, I caught up with Myles Worthington via email this week. You can read all about Bailey and OBS Studio on Protocol.com, but a few tidbits about the future of the broadcast tool didn’t make it into the story. This week, Singapore-based YouTuber Lazius Kaye made waves on Twitter for posting a Japanese ad for Meta’s Quest 2 headset. “Love dem or hate dem, you can’t deny this is something that makes people feel excited about VR,” he wrote, and lots of people on Twitter agreed. “[W]e’re finally getting decent VR commercials with the energy it deserves,” one Twitter user responded, while someone else tweeted, “[I]f only Meta Connect looked more like this.” The big question: Mastodon or Mastodon’t? Many people have discovered the federated social media network Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter in recent days. Should brands follow them, or is it too early for that? FIFA goes big on blockchain gaming. No, not the gaming franchise from EA, but the actual international footballing body. FIFA, which will split with EA next year, now plans to launch four blockchain-based games in time for the Qatar World Cup this month. The fast-food brand appears to have taken a bit of a Twitter break this month, and it’s not alone: Usually sassy brand accounts like Wendy’s and Panera have notably dialed down their output on the social network in recent days, apparently waiting to see what Twitter will look like once Musk’s verification and content moderation changes take effect. When I first began working on a story on OBS Studio, an app that is being used by many Twitch and YouTube live streamers to power their broadcasts, I simply wanted to highlight yet another open-source project that’s been essential to a massive and growing trend in online media. You know who still hasn’t commented on Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and everything that has transpired since? Chipotle. Netflix is eyeing sports. The streaming service doesn’t want to bid for expensive sports rights, so it is considering investing in niche sports leagues instead. It was that last part that eventually evolved into its own meme, with Twitter users sharing photos of iconic pop cultural references of islands captioned with the same sentence —  the Catalina Wine Mixer from Stepbrothers, Jurassic Park, and of course, the notoriously disastrous Fyre Festival. What these memes illustrated, however, is that it’s highly possible that perhaps what really annoyed people wasn’t the fact that a rich person went to a private island with their friends during the pandemic, but Kim’s insistence that it was done perfectly safely. At this point, the most surprising aspect of Kim Kardashian’s birthday trip is why any of it is surprising at all. Of course celebrities are still going to do celebrity things, because they can. Despite the fact that California, where the Kardashians live, has advised against all forms of nonessential travel, this doesn’t actually mean anything. Flying, private or otherwise is not against the law. The reaction was predictable: Responses to her original tweet accentuated its tone-deafness in the face of mass suffering. “Wow so fun my family still hasn’t met my six month old baby but I’m glad you’re rich!” tweeted McSweeney’s editor Lucy Huber. “You know what would have felt normal for me, Kim? Not having to say goodbye to my mother over FaceTime as she was dying of COVID. Not hearing her ashes be interred over the goddamned phone so I wouldn’t put my dad and sister at risk.” But, within days of quasi-lockdowns appearing in the US, it became clear that famous people would not, actually, be living anything comparable to average quarantined life. Fashion blogger Arielle Charnas received so much backlash for escaping her New York City apartment to a rental house in the Hamptons while having tested positive for coronavirus that she turned off comments on her Instagram; TikTok superstars refused to stop hosting massive parties even after the city of Los Angeles cut off their power. I’m reminded of a recent essay by the New Yorker’s Katy Waldman, who criticized this very tendency in popular fiction. “These self-conscious times have furnished us with a new fallacy. Call it the reflexivity trap. This is the implicit, and sometimes explicit, idea that professing awareness of a fault absolves you of that fault — that lip service equals resistance.” Performative allyship (think the black squares on Instagram, social justice slideshows, or “self-protective irony”) are what Waldman is referring to, the subject of many recent conversations around what “counts” as being a good person. Beyond the performative quarantining, too, Kim’s language in her tweet is telling. As Rebecca Alter noted in Vulture, “This display of exorbitant wealth and privilege during a time of record unemployment and disease is made all the more blatantly icky by Kim’s couching it all in the language of gratitude.” We tend to praise this sort of acknowledgement of our own good fortune, particularly among white people who have been taught that by simply reflecting on white privilege that they are doing the real work of dismantling white supremacy. “Rubbing in this our faces is cruel & clueless,” added Food & Wine senior editor Kat Kinsman. Rock legend Peter Frampton even jumped in, writing, “Are you that insensitive you don’t realise this is not what the majority of people during the worst covid spike yet want to hear? People are going to food banks not private islands.” Many others shared a gif of the iconic quote from Keeping Up with the Kardashians, when Kim cries over a lost diamond earring in the ocean and Kourtney quips, “Kim, there’s people that are dying.” (As these things often go, plenty of other commenters lambasted those griping for their “jealousy” and “hate.”) There is an easier solution to this problem: Just don’t post anything to begin with. Even before Kim Kardashian’s birthday, people have expressed frustration with those in their circle who not only are going on vacations but continue to share photos of them. The pandemic has created a stark divide between people who continue their normal social media habits and for those who think that any type of performance of normal life online is an affront to everyone else. It’s one thing when a paparazzi happens to be in the right place at the right time, sneaking a photo of a celebrity in a compromising position like being caught cheating on a partner or committing the mortal sin of having a normal-looking body. But it is almost always more interesting when a celebrity — completely, ignorantly, and willingly — tells on themself.

Even as the MCD election was underway on Sunday, the AAP and the BJP took a dig at each other – AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urged people to vote for an “honest party” that does not litter the city, while BJP MP Manoj Tiwari accused the AAP of allegedly deleting names from voter lists. After learning about the matter, Ravi said he reached out to the presiding officer in the polling booth who claimed that the said voters are not on his list. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor alleged that recorded messages of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealing people to vote for the AAP were received by lakhs of people on the day of polling. He said it was a violation of model code of conduct and lodged a complaint with the State Election Commission. The party also lodged a complaint against AAP MLA Durgesh Pathak and another party leader Vijendra Garg. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal cast his vote in the MCD polls and had appealed to the public to vote for a party that works for people rather than creating hurdles. “People should vote for the party that’s honest and works. For those who focus on the cleanliness of the city and not those who keep creating hurdles,” he told reporters, PTI reported. Over the past few weeks in the run-up to Sunday’s MCD elections, major political parties tried to outdo each with stickers, flags, and placards for their campaign, but one strategy was common — roping in autorickshaws. Fitted with loudspeakers, the vehicles blared campaign songs and slogans from dawn to dusk. While campaigning for the polls ended on Friday, The Indian Express spoke to a few auto drivers across the city to find out what the job involved. In South Delhi’s Kalkaji, Govind Barman said he showed up for work around 8 am and drove his auto till around 9 pm, even as its speakers broadcasted the chant, “MCD mein bhi Kejriwal.” In his complaint, Delhi BJP's Legal cell co-convener sanket Gupta alleged that both Pathak and Garg violated model code of conduct by campaigning on the night of December 3 which was ""silence period"" before voting. The complaint also cited a viral social media video of the two AAP leaders allegedly campaigning. The party demanded the Election Commission to direct police to register an FIR against Pathak and Garg. (PTI) Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur was among senior BJP leaders who made a pitch for BJP candidates Friday, the last day of campaigning for the MCD polls. Thakur, who campaigned in parts of East Patel Nagar, Naraina, Mangolpuri and Ranjit Nagar, said: “Arvind Kejriwal came to power by talking of politics of change. For them, the meaning of changing politics was to openly give protection to rioters and the corrupt. Today, rioters, corrupt and criminals from Delhi to Punjab have open protection of Kejriwal. These are the same people who did the work of throwing… Delhi into riots on the arrival of the President of US to India. Petrol bombs and stones were recovered from houses of AAP leaders and Kejriwal was saving these rioters, giving them a clean chit.” After casting his vote along with his family at a polling centre in Civil Lines, Kejriwal said, “Today, I went with my whole family and voted to form an honest government in the municipal corporation. Today is a holiday… You all must go and vote with your family. Ask your neighbours and acquaintances also to vote. Together, we will make Delhi clean and beautiful.” (Read More) Over the past few weeks in the run-up to Sunday’s MCD elections, major political parties tried to outdo each with stickers, flags, and placards for their campaign, but one strategy was common — roping in autorickshaws.

Like a typical politician, Arvind Kejriwal started selling dreams. He promised eight lakh new jobs for Delhiites in the 2015 manifesto but skipped this issue altogether in his poll campaign and the party manifesto in 2020 elections. He promised to make Delhi “pollution-free” in the 2015 manifesto; in the 2020 manifesto, he has promised to reduce pollution by a third. His politics of ‘soft nationalism’ encapsulated by his support for the invalidation of Article 370 and ‘soft Hindutva’ showcased by his recital of the Hanuman Chalisa and visits to the Hanuman temple could also become a model for many other opposition parties to follow. Kejriwal managed to beat the BJP’s aggressive nationalism and communal narrative centred on Shaheen Bagh by focusing on the AAP government’s achievements. Post-Anna Hazare agitation, Kejriwal had got some traction nationally as a leader pursuing alternative politics. That aura is nowhere there as the Delhi chief minister started playing identity politics — calling himself ‘a baniya’, asking party colleagues to change or shed their titles for political convenience and courting ethnic groups — like thoroughbred politicians. That plan went awry as Kejriwal lost the plot midway. Even when the AAP was going strong in Delhi, especially after the chief minister decided to shed his anarchist tag and focus on governance issues 2018 onwards, people outside Delhi stopped taking it seriously. But is that enough to propel him onto the national political centrestage? Political observers believe the voters in the national capital made a conscious choice — Narendra Modi as prime minister and Arvind Kejriwal as chief minister. To that extent, the latter is far from becoming a challenger to the former nationally. It’s also a fact that the Congress, which seemed to be on course to recovery in Delhi’s civic polls and Lok Sabha elections, virtually withdrew from the race in the assembly elections, which bolstered the AAP’s chances. If the Congress had put up a fight, the Delhi results could have been different. His anti-corruption crusade has lost steam. Delhi’s water minister Kapil Mishra, who was sacked by Kejriwal, had claimed that it was done because of his demand for action in a huge ‘tanker scam’. AAP insiders have pointed out how money bags were getting priority in the allotment of party tickets and Rajya Sabha nominations. According to a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms, 51 of the 70 AAP candidates are millionaires. The election watch body’s report also said that more than half of the AAP’s candidates faced criminal cases. The AAP has also stopped publishing the list of its donors on its website.

True. Delhi voters who voted for AAP have not made a good choice. Basically, Congress votes have also gone to AAP. BJP Delhi politicians should work harder specially MCD members. Let us see how it goes in the next five years. But Arvind will try hard again for national politics as he knows that there is not much to do here and BJP will keep pestering him. He said Delhi people can make videos telling people of other states about work done by AAP and appeal to them to give Kejriwal/AAP a chance, ahead of polls. He also urged people to upload these videos on social media. In the video the people can talk about the work done by the government in the capital and people whose video goes viral will get a chance to have dinner with Arvind Kejriwal he said in a press conference. This campaign comes ahead of the Assembly elections. He said that people are free to talk about the things they liked and disliked about the work done by the government in their video. They can then share it on their social media or even send it to people they know in the states that are about to go into elections. The Assembly Elections and all eyes are set on Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Goa & Uttarakhand, where Aam Aadmi Party is contesting elections, he adds that he has worked with full honesty and the party doesn't have crores to a campaign. He further requests AAP volunteers to help make the videos go viral and said that videos that do go viral he'll pick 50 Delhiites, interact with them and have dinner with them after the elections.

Meanwhile, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, in a letter written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, accused him of remaining silent on the issue of stubble burning in Punjab ever since AAP formed a government in the State.

GSN has no legal right over the Gandhi Ashram and its precincts, said Atul Pandya, director of one of the trusts, in its affidavit. The state government further stated in their affidavit that the Gandhi Ashram does not give appropriate information about the whole Ashram as formed by Gandhiji and the ideology propounded by the Father of the Nation. The govt added that it is expected of the petitioner to take pride in the fact that attempts are being made to maintain Gandhiji’s legacy, but instead, the petitioner has just expressed unhappiness for no good reason, it added. However, Tushar filed the PIL, disputing the renovation under a body dominated by government office bearers and employees, claiming that excluding Gandhian trusts will result in the new premises losing the Gandhian ethos. The Gujarat HC dismissed Gandhi’s plea on November 21, 2021. News and opinion website that brings you reports and narrative from a perspective often ignored or suppressed by the mainstream media of India. When questioned whether the state is willing to make Gandhi’s descendant an invitee to the committee overseeing the development, advocate general Kamal Trivedi, appearing for the Gujarat government told the CJ of Gujarat HC, “Certainly this can be done, but he can’t dictate (terms).” On April 25, the state government submitted an affidavit in response to the public interest litigation (PIL). The state government refused that the proposed revamp will lose the essence of simplicity and Gandhian ethos. Tushar Gandhi then moved the Supreme Court opposing the redevelopment of Sabarmati Ashram. In March 2022, the apex court agreed to hear the plea filed by Mahatma Gandhi’s great-grandson and asked the HC to examine the plea and said that it is not going into the merits of the case. The Gujarat state government cleared in High Court on Monday (August 1), that MK Gandhi’s descendant could definitely be made an invitee to the committee overseeing the re-development work of the Sabarmati Ashram but could not dictate terms. Speaking to ThePrint, the head of the executive council and chief principal secretary to the CM, K. Kailashnathan said that any talk of any part of the ashram being demolished was a myth. “My contention is that if the ashram complex is to be treated like a theme park, it is a great insult to Gandhi. Look at the government’s mindset — it recently celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Gujarat’s renowned poet Zaverchand Meghani, and there was no photo of him on the poster and stage,” Prakash N. Shah, who led the petition opposing the plan, told ThePrint. “The ashram doesn’t need to be made into a ‘world-class memorial’ — it is already world-class and people take inspiration from it. And nothing is being promised in writing (by the government), they are only saying things verbally. Why should we believe them,” Vidrohi asked. Also read: Shaheen Bagh couldn’t get CAA revoked. But Gandhi’s satyagraha didn’t meet its goal either “Here, a political party which belongs to the ideology that killed Gandhi, and says nothing when Nathuram Godse is worshipped, is doing all this,” she alleged. “Personally, I would say that we have wanted the Ashram Road, which has become a busy, commercial road, to be diverted for a long time. We should not have let that happen. Here, ‘we’ is not just the six trusts, but also the citizens. We couldn’t retain the peaceful environment around the ashram. However, one thing that hurts is how the Trust and other stakeholders were not involved since the beginning of this plan,” said trustee Sudarshan Iyengar. “The Prime Minister has indicated that he does not envisage this effort as a way of governmentalizing the precinct, but rather a way of ensuring that each visitor gets the experience that would be befitting this historic place,” the statement added. Dismissing speculation of the renovated ashram complex including a VIP lounge and a food court, as mentioned in many news reports — which according to many Gandhians go against the ethos and culture of the ashram — a source in HCP said, “There would be basic facilities. If the footfall is going to increase, it is only natural to have some more parking facilities, toilets, or maybe a place to get water and tea, but no extravagant food court will be created.” They alleged that the plan to make Gandhi Ashram a “world-class” memorial, will “severely compromise and trivialise the sanctity of the ashram”. They also expressed their concern over the “frightening aspect” of the government taking control over all Gandhian archives.

As a Leader of Opposition, he was leading the attack on the Centre and now, as the Congress president, he will take along everybody to fight against the Narendra Modi government,” said Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole. Democrats and some Republicans blamed Trump for inciting the violence on Wednesday. ""I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election,"" Trump said, repeating familiar falsehoods. ""But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order."" He posted another message that called the mob ""great patriots"" who were reacting to an election victory ""viciously stripped away."" Twitter later hid three tweets and locked Trump's account. Trump's failure to rein in his supporters stood in sharp contrast to his attitude last summer when he threatened arrests and the use of force to break up protests against racial inequality. ""Today's violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump,"" Jim Mattis, a former defense secretary under Trump, said in a statement. Yet Trump's rally speech on Wednesday was filled with grievances and voter fraud allegations that have not been backed up with evidence. The chaos in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday unfolded after President Donald Trump spent weeks whipping up his supporters with false allegations of fraud in the Nov. 3 election, culminating in a call to march to the building that represents U.S. democracy. He singled out several Republican lawmakers for criticism, including Senator Mitt Romney and Representative Liz Cheney, while hailing as heroes those who have sided with him to stop the electoral votes from being certified. Protesters fought through police barricades, stormed the building and entered lawmakers' chambers. The certification process was stopped and Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress were evacuated.One civilian was shot dead, Washington police said. As night fell, a Capitol official said the building had been cleared, but outside some way from the grounds, scores of protesters remained, including members of militia and far-right groups.

By India Today Web Desk: Supporters of US President Donald Trump breached the Capitol building in Washington DC on Wednesday in an attempt to stop the US Congress from ratifying the Electoral College vote that would officially confirm Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump. Trump supporters created chaos that resulted in rioting and violence, forcing world leaders to codemn the ugly scenes. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol building ""domestic terrorists"". In a tweet, Trump attacked his own Vice President saying, ""Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!"" ""The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect the true America. Do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it's disorder,"" Biden went on to add. ""I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,"" former US President George W Bush said in a statement.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Shimla Devi on Wednesday proved exit polls wrong as she won from Ward No.241 Karawal Nagar-East, which is reserved for women, in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections. Part of the North East Delhi district and Mustafabad Assembly constituency and North East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency of Delhi, Karawal Nagar had hit headlines in 2020 when riots over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) broke out in the area, leading to the death of 53 people.

The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party came into maximum possible control of Delhi on Wednesday, winning 134 of the total 250 wards in the first unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections, dislodging the BJP.

With no actual prosecutorial powers -- the Justice Department is pursuing a parallel criminal investigation -- the panel sees its job as convicting Trump in the court of public opinion. A minute-by-minute visual breakdown -- much of it composed of new footage -- served as a painful reminder of the mayhem that played out as a mob attempted to disrupt the formal vote by lawmakers to transfer power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Also Read — US Capitol riot probe puts Donald Trump at heart of 'attempted coup' The former president -- still the nearest thing Republicans have to an official party leader -- wasn't present as lawmakers set out their case that he was to blame for the insurrection that left five dead in January 2021, just across the road. US Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards also gave an account of the violence, in which she was concussed when she cracked her head on the Capitol steps after being knocked over by the surging mob. Video images capturing the raging anger and violence of the mob ransacking the US Congress provided a vivid and visceral picture of the 2021 insurrection on Capitol Hill. Police officers were seen desperately trying -- and failing -- to keep the crowd at bay as rioters climbed scaffolding, hurled chairs and eventually breached the halls of Congress. There were excerpts of taped interviews with Trump administration and campaign officials who told members of Trump's inner circle there was no justification for overturning the election. ""When lawful action is taking place in a case of corruption, Congress is doing this drama and blocking roads....it shows the party considers its leaders above law,"" BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra said. Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, claimed that the Centre is scared of Gandhi's politics as he is raising issues concerning the public and asked whether he has become a hurdle in the path of Prime Minister Narendra Modi protecting the interests of his ""cronies"". Venugopal said this is nothing but ""political vendetta"" by the Modi government, which is trying to defame the Congress leadership through ""false cases"". The Congress has accused the Centre of targeting opposition leaders by misusing investigative agencies. The BJP hit out at the opposition party, saying it is blocking roads to show its ""leaders are above the law"" and termed the protests ""drama"". ""This entire exercise is illegal, unconstitutional, malicious and an exercise by a prime minister burning in the fire of political vendetta,"" Surjewala told a press conference here. They, however, had contended in the high court that Swamy's plea was ""misconceived and premature"". K C Venugopal and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury were among scores of party leaders detained for violating prohibitory orders outside the heavily barricaded party office on Akbar road. The probe pertains to alleged financial irregularities in Young Indian Private Limited, promoted by the Congress, that owns National Herald. Union minister Anurag Thakur also took a swipe at Rahul Gandhi over his questioning by the ED after the Congress leader criticised prime minister's decision to provide 10 lakh government jobs in the next 18 months. In the final stages of the campaign, a row began over a morphed video wrongly attributed to Dr Joseph. The CPI(M) alleged that Congress was behind the “heinous game”, and a few Congress leaders were arrested for allegedly circulating the video. The Opposition party claimed that the video had come from CPI(M) circles and Satheesan dared the police to arrest those who had uploaded the clip. The campaigning period saw often heated exchanges between the ruling coalition and the Congress, and a host of controversies erupted in the past few weeks. These rows put on the backburner any debate around the SilverLine Project and the government’s development agenda. The first row erupted when the CPI(M) introduced Dr Joseph as its candidate from the premises of a Church-run hospital and in the presence of Catholic priests. This led to the Opposition painting the cardiologist as a “Church candidate” but the Congress, fearing a backlash, did not push ahead with this line of attack. Addressing voters on Friday, Vijayan hit out at the BJP for trying to get Christian votes even though, he alleged, the Sangh Parivar targets the community. He recalled incidents such as the Kandhamal violence of 2008 and the murder of Graham Staines’ family in 1999. “They (BJP) are wolves in sheep’s clothing,” the CM added. The party backed senior politician P C George after he was arrested over an alleged hate speech against Muslims. George, a former legislator of regional Christian party Kerala Congress (M), extended support to the BJP on the last day of campaigning on Sunday and hit out at Vijayan. The state government, he added, put him in jail but had not taken action against those who had allegedly made derogatory remarks about Christians and Hindus. The BJP, which is not expected to pose any substantial challenge to the Left and the Congress, focussed on splitting the Christian vote during the campaign. It labelled both the CPI(M) and the Congress as “anti-Christian” parties that are soft on “Muslim fundamentalism”. Referring to the video controversy, Satheesan said the government was afraid of revealing those who were actually behind the morphed clip. “Why can’t the government find those who uploaded the video? I am sure CPI(M) men were behind it,’’ he alleged. Lashing out at the Congress over the video controversy, Vijayan said, “People will give a fitting reply to the Congress for the malicious campaign.’’ In response, Satheesan accused the CPI(M) and the CM of bargaining with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), which is the political wing of the Popular Front of India, over the past month. “All the ministers of the Vijayan cabinet have been after communal outfits in the constituency. We do not solicit the votes of communal elements. We will win with secular votes,’’ he added. For the Left, victory in the by-poll will take its tally in the 140-member House to 100 and will be interpreted as a mandate for the proposed semi-high-speed SilverLine rail corridor that has received a lot of pushback from the Opposition. For the Congress, it will be an electoral test for its new state leadership led by K Sudhakaran, the current state unit president, and Opposition leader V D Satheesan. It will also provide a broad indication of whether Christian votes are with the party. The community forms around 40 per cent of the electorate in Thrikkakara but in recent times several Christian faces have exited the Congress. The UDF has won the constituency since 2011. Another factor that may affect the poll outcome is the votes of “apolitical” outfit Twenty20, which was floated years ago by garment major KITEX. The outfit has announced a tie-up with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) but the front is not contesting the by-poll. In the 2021 Assembly election, Twenty20 secured 13,800 votes while the AAP had bagged 9,300 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from the Assembly segment, which is a part of the Ernakulam parliamentary seat. Responding to the violence, Sweden has been attacked by Muslim countries, especially the Islamic countries in the Middle East, over the acts of ‘deliberate provocation’ against Muslims by senior political leaders in the country. Saudi Arabia, in a statement, has condemned the act of burning the holy book in Sweden saying, “deliberate abuse of the holy Quran by some extremists in Sweden, and provocation and incitement against Muslims”.

On Sunday, Palestinian extremists threw stones to block Jewish visitors at Temple Mount at a bus near Jerusalem’s Old City. Earlier, Iraq’s foreign ministry summoned Sweden’s charge d’affaires (deputy ambassador), Hakan Rooth over the incident. In a strong condemnation, Iraq said that the incident “bears grave implications on Sweden’s relations with all Muslims.” In Tehran, on Monday, The Foreign Ministry of Iran too condemned the ‘sacrilegious move’ of burning the Quran under the ‘pretext of freedom of speech and with the support of the Swedish police.’ Iran called for immediate and decisive action by the Swedish government to end any desecration of the Holy Quran furthermore. Riots roiled cities across Sweden after Danish anti-immigration party Stram Kurs on April 14 announced to burn a copy of the Quran.

On Monday, the Swedish police said 26 police officers and 14 civilians had been injured in the violence and that more than 20 vehicles had been damaged or destroyed. Rasmus Paludan, a Swedish politician has vowed to burn down the Quran again while he is touring the country to gather political support. Agencies monitoring the situation in the capital since the unprecedented violence broke out in northeast Delhi have noticed a trend in which panic is being created in the parts of the city by making bogus calls to police control room. On Sunday evening, the police urged people not to believe in rumours circulating on social media and said they have detained some people for spreading rumours. Amid reports of fresh violence, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had shut the entry and exit gates of Tilak Nagar, Nangloi, Surajmal Stadium, Badarpur, Tughlakabad, Uttam Nagar West and Nawada stations. The stations were later opened. ""All of them turned out to be bogus calls. But panic seem to have gripped the city,"" a senior police officer said. According to him, the panic started at around 7 pm when the police raided a gambling racket at a local market in wet Delhi's Khayala. ""People present there started running, which created panic in the area. Some said that some fired at the police. Some channels even flashed that gamblers threw stones at the police. Both turned out to be fake narratives,"" the officer said. ""Please remember that such activities over the internet leave digital footprints. Instigating a riot can have severe consequences ...And severe criminal liability follows. Please be responsible citizens.

The violence in northeast Delhi last week left 46 people dead and hundreds injured. ""Some anti-social elements have spread rumours. We received many PCR calls. The situation is completely normal. Police personnel have been deployed everywhere. Don't pay attention to rumours and inform police about it,"" Delhi Police public relations officer MS Randhawa told news agency ANI.

The messages misinterpret various sections from the book and string these instances together into a 700-word long tirade against the Congress-led governments of 1980s and 1990s, the Gandhi family and the World Bank.

I observe with as much pathos that redrawing boundaries of fiscal and bank accounting won’t improve their fundamental health and prospects. First, the central bank is kept distracted away from achieving its long-term objectives of price stability and financial stability; in turn, runaway inflation and chronically weak bank lending create stagflation (stagnant growth and high inflation), occasionally spooking external sector investors, and worse, at times even bank depositors and market investors in the financial sector.

Opinion | Harsh Mander writes: Solidarity is a potent weapon against pandemic, prejudice weakens us all Will loan stress caused by the pandemic impact the banking system? A recent merger proposal had come from AION-backed Clix Capital but the discussions didn’t work out. The bank was earlier wooed by SREI Capital. It almost tied up with Indiabulls Housing Finance, but the RBI objected to the merger proposal. The bank management had indicated to the RBI that it was in talks with certain investors, but failed to submit any concrete proposal. After the failures of IL&FS, Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative Bank and DHFL, and the bailout of Yes Bank, the Reserve Bank of India decision to impose a 30-day moratorium on Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd (LVB) and put in place a draft scheme for its amalgamation with DBS Bank India, a subsidiary of DBS of Singapore, has raised concerns about the safety of the financial system. What has been the regulatory response to these failures? Several claims about the health of the Indian economy under Prime Minister Narendra Modi have gone viral on WhatsApp groups. On carefully examining the claims, two of the four claims were found to be falsely attributed to global investment banking and research firm Morgan Stanley. One of them is true, but dated and from 2017, while another claim attributed to Forbes, is unverifiable. This claim is misleading, as it is dated. Secondly, it is not a claim being made by Morgan Stanley. We have had these discussions in the early 2000s on using the RBI reserves for funding infrastructure. Then RBI Deputy Governor YV Reddy objected to using these reserves saying we earn reserves from short-term foreign capital flows which could reverse unlike China which earns reserves from its exports. Some of this justification applies today but the ever prudent YVR has also mentioned the need to have escape clauses in matters of public policy. One also hears economists and politicians pop the question: ‘Where is the money for vaccines’? This is surprising as both on moral and economics grounds this should not be a question at all. On the moral front, people are dying and suffering in unimaginable ways. Vaccine is seen as a way to mitigate the impact of the disease, and thus reduce suffering. Who else but the State to help vaccinate people?"

Mainstream media outlets in India along with some popular social media accounts have been abuzz with talks about 'civil war' happening in Pakistan. However, experts believe this to be a disinformation campaign that grossly misrepresents an ongoing political crisis in the country. Some less known accounts like The International Herald (@TheIntlHerald) and Dr. APR (@drapr007) also 'reported' violent clashes in Pakistan, with one of the accounts posting an obscure video purportedly showing the supposed 'civil war' in Pakistan. Michael Kugelman, the Deputy Director of the Asia Program and Senior Associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars also tweeted out saying that the reports of civil war in Pakistan were false and part of a disinformation campaign. In response, Pakistani media challenged the narrative by their Indian counterparts by fact checking the claims around a civil war, while social media users had a field day trolling the Indian media with photoshopped images of supposed violence happening in Pakistan. BREAKING : Civil war in Pakistan. Reported clashes between Karachi Police & Pak Army pic.twitter.com/tQsUWPx5pa Indian disinformation accounts are exploiting Pakistan's current political crisis and falsely claiming that the country is now experiencing urban warfare and other serious instability. Dangerous and disturbing; several of these accounts are verified, with large followings. Ugh. BOOM spoke to Karachi-based journalist Muhammad Omer Hayat, who refuted the 'civil war' narrative. ""It is a gross misrepresentation of the political turmoil that is going on currently in the country. There is definitely no civil war here,"" Hayat told BOOM. If the ' news reports' originating in India re troops-police firefights etc in Karachi are an example of the 5th generation warfare we are constantly being warned of, we have nothing to worry about except whatever the consequences of laughing our heads off. Worsening the situation was the arrest of  Captain Muhammad Safdar - the son-in-law of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, along with the 'kidnapping' of Sindh police inspector general Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar last Wednesday, in order to force him to sign an arrest warrant for Opposition leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, a spokesman for Pakistan Peoples Party that currently holds power in the Sindh province. India buzzes with fake news of 'civil war' in Pakistan EU DisinfoLab are an independent NGO ""focused on tackling sophisticated disinformation campaigns targeting the EU, its member states, core institutions, and core values"". Their researchers, who are based in Brussels, believe the network's purpose is to disseminate propaganda against India's neighbour and rival Pakistan. Both countries have long sought to control the narrative against the other. Aglaya's marketing brochure mentioned the ability to ""hamper country level reputations"" and described some of its services as ""Cyber Nukes"". In a 2017 interview with Forbes magazine, a man called Ankur Srivastava claimed he ""only sold to Indian intelligence agencies"". The network was designed primarily to ""discredit Pakistan internationally"" and influence decision-making at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and European Parliament, EU DisinfoLab said. ""If the Indian government is behind the newspaper [EU Chronicle], it is not my problem,"" Mr Mariani, a member of France's far-right National Rally, told the BBC. Mr Nimmo, who is director of investigations at digital monitoring firm Graphika, cited previous examples of privately-run large-scale troll operations. ""Just because they're big, it doesn't necessarily mean they're directly run by the state,"" he said. The EU DisinfoLab report said: ""The actors behind the operation hijacked the names of others, tried to impersonate regular media such as the EU Observer... used the letterhead of the European Parliament, registered websites under avatars with fake phone numbers, provided fake addresses to the United Nations, created publishing companies to print books of the think-tanks they owned. One of the most important findings of the open-source investigation was establishing direct links between the Srivastava Group (SG) and at least 10 UN-accredited NGOs, along with several others, which were used to promote Indian interests and criticise Pakistan internationally. There is no evidence the network is linked to India's government, but it relies heavily on amplifying content produced on fake media outlets with the help of Asian News International (ANI) - India's largest wire service and a key focus of the investigation. ""They used layers of fake media that would quote and republish one another. They used politicians who genuinely wanted to defend women or minority rights to ultimately serve geopolitical interests and gave a platform to far-right politicians when convergent objectives could be reached."" 15. Indian Media Trolled For False Claims Of ‘Civil War’ In Pakistan At the height of the pandemic, news agency IANS published a news report, claiming that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said the coronavirus curve was flattening, after he erroneously read the curve upside down. We found that the claim originated from a Pakistani satire website called The Dependent, and had no link to reality. Read here In October, news outlets News18 and Zee News reported about a ‘civil war’ breaking out in Pakistan to describe a political crisis going on in the country. These rumours were quickly dispelled by experts and residents of Pakistan, which quickly led to a barrage of trolling by social media users. Read here.

We found these claims to be highly misleading in nature. Eventually, the Information and Broadcast Ministry submitted an order, cautioning the channel over the ‘offensive’ content of the show, to the Supreme Court. Read here.

TOI, HT, ABP News Fall For Fake Account Impersonating Indrajit Chakraborty The government is increasingly using technology to curtail human rights and stifle freedom of expression online. In February 2021, the Indian government published the Information Technology Rules, which imperil freedom of expression and the right to privacy. These rules empower the government to summarily compel the removal of online content without any judicial oversight. They also jeopardize encryption, which is crucial for ensuring privacy and security online, and routinely used by journalists to protect their sources and themselves from being targeted. The Editors Guild of India said the rules undermined media freedom. Three UN human rights experts have expressed concern that the rules do not conform with international human rights norms. These restrictions on media freedom come amid an escalating crackdown on civil society by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government, which is using sedition, counterterrorism, and national security laws to target and prosecute human rights activists, students, government critics, and peaceful protesters. Journalists from minority groups and those in Jammu and Kashmir are particularly at risk, the groups said. The Pegasus Project found that over 40 Indian journalists appeared on a leaked list of potential targets for surveillance. The Indian government has repeatedly stalled attempts to investigate these allegations. This perpetuates an environment of surveillance impunity that results in a chilling effect on free speech and media freedoms, the groups said. In March 2022, airport authorities in Mumbai prevented Rana Ayyub, a prominent Muslim female journalist and an outspoken critic of the BJP, from flying to London to address a journalism event. The authorities said they did so because of an ongoing investigation into money laundering and tax evasion, allegations Ayyub has denied. Independent United Nations human rights experts have alleged that Indian authorities have harassed Ayyub for years. Government supporters and Hindu nationalist trolls have repeatedly abused and threatened Ayyub on social media. The authorities’ targeting of journalists, coupled with a broader crackdown on dissent, has emboldened Hindu nationalists to threaten, harass, and abuse journalists critical of the Indian government, both online and offline, with impunity, the groups said. (New York) – Indian authorities are increasingly targeting journalists and online critics for their criticism of government policies and practices, including by prosecuting them under counterterrorism and sedition laws, ten human rights organizations said today on World Press Freedom Day. Siddique Kappan, another Muslim journalist, has been in prison since October 2020, when Uttar Pradesh police arrested him on baseless charges of terrorism, sedition, and promoting enmity between groups, among others. At the time of his arrest, Kappan had been on his way from New Delhi to Hathras district in Uttar Pradesh to report on a gang rape and murder case of a young Dalit woman that had sparked nationwide protests. Amid growing restrictions on media freedom, Indian authorities have arrested journalists on spurious terrorism and sedition charges, and have routinely targeted critics and independent news organizations, including raiding their workplaces. Journalists and online critics also risk prosecution under the Information Technology Act and IT Rules of 2021 for content critical of the authorities. Indian authorities have been implicated in using the Israeli-produced spyware Pegasus to target journalists. In addition, the authorities’ frequent internet shutdowns hamper the ability of journalists to do their work, including accessing and disseminating information online. In April 2022, at least five journalists covering an event organized by Hindu nationalist groups in Delhi were attacked. Delhi police subsequently opened a criminal investigation into one of these journalists, Meer Faisal, accusing him of inciting hatred through a tweet, in which he alleged that participants in the event attacked him and a photojournalist because they were Muslim. The Committee to Protect Journalists found that at least 20 female Muslim journalists, including Ayyub, had been listed on a fake “auction” app as “for sale” to humiliate, degrade, and intimidate them. All of these journalists have reported critically on how the BJP government’s policies have affected religious minorities. Many women journalists in India, especially those who are critical of the government, face a growing backlash on social media that has included rape and death threats. The abuses often come from account holders who identify themselves as BJP supporters. Prior to Sehwag's post in Shami's defense, the online mob attacked the Indian stalwart by writing obnoxious comments on the bowler's social media accounts. Several socio-political activists, writers, and workers slammed these online attacks of Islamophobic hate against Shami on social media as soon as the fast bowlers' public shaming gained traction in the trending topics on Twitter. ""The online attack on Mohammad Shami is shocking and we stand by him. He is a champion and Anyone who wears the India cap has India in their hearts far more than any online mob.  With you Shami. Agle match mein dikado jalwa,"" wrote Sehwag in his tweet. Check out Sehwag's tweet here: “It is said that in Pakistan, journalists do not have security and they are facing threats. This is international propaganda,” he said, though he did not give any reply to the questions raised by the opposition members regarding the recent attacks on Matiuallah Jan, Absar Alam and Sajid Toor and a ban on TV anchor Hamid Mir. The minister told the lower house of parliament that recently an “info-lab” was detected through which 845 fake websites had been created that fed fake news against Pakistan to the international media. Through these websites, he said, the Kashmir struggle was being questioned and particularly “sub-nationalism in Balochistan” was being promoted. ISLAMABAD: Expressing concern over the ongoing anti-Pakistan propaganda campaign on social media, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry on Monday said that during the recent protests by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) on the blasphemy issue, more than 300,000 tweets originated from Indian city of Ahmedabad within three-and-a-half minutes. He said that two journalists — ­Aziz Memon and Ajay Malwani — were murdered in PPP-ruled Sindh and there had been no progress in the two cases. The minister said wars in the world were now fought through the victory of one’s narrative. Ironically, no heed was paid to that aspect in past, he regretted. The information minister claimed that there was no threat to journalists in the country and termed such reports a part of the international campaign to defame Pakistan. The minister admitted that the External Publicity Wing (EPW) of his ministry was not performing well and it had failed to project Pakistan’s narrative at the international level over the past 20 years when the country fought a war against terrorism. He, however, held the previous governments’ “weak media policy” as responsible for the state of affairs in the EPW. Besides this, he said, the total allocated budget of the EPW was Rs40.5 million, whereas India was spending Rs21 billion for this purpose. And this, he said, not included the budget of Bollywood which made films against Pakistan. The minister said this in his winding up speech in the National Assembly during a debate on the cut motions moved by the opposition members seeking symbolic reduction in the allocation for the information ministry due to its poor performance. Weeks before presentation of the budget, the opposition leaders, including Leader of the Opposition and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, had repeatedly announced that they would not let the government pass the budget from parliament and do whatever they could to achieve this goal. In Mr Khan’s case, he said, he was shifted from Wazirabad to Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital, Lahore, which was not authorised to issue an officially acceptable medico-legal certificate. He said there were reports that the Punjab government had sent a team of doctors from the public sector Jinnah Hospital Lahore to Shaukat Khanum to complete legal formalities. Reports suggest Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi is caught between ‘the devil and the deep blue sea’ as Mr Khan, who essentially calls the shots for the ruling coalition in Punjab, continues to insist on nominating the army officer in the FIR. Sharing the political dimensions of the issue, the source said CM Elahi was against the ‘logic’ of nominating the senior army officer in the case. The CM and PTI leaders held many meetings on the issue where the former attempted to convince them to drop the name of the army officer, the source added. However, when the security advisory was violated, the police then suggested the security officers of Imran Khan to give access to the police on the container to take control of his security. Yet the security staff refused to allow the armed police to get into the container, where Mr Khan was physically interacting with everyone reaching there and this ‘blatant violation’ had irked the police high-ups. He said the Punjab police chief had taken up this issue with the provincial government in Friday’s meeting of the sub-cabinet committee, where he unveiled that Mr Khan’s private security had violated the advisory issued by the police. He also pointed out several other legal flaws that could create troubles for the investigators in the court of law, saying that when Mr Khan got firearm injury he was first to be shifted to the nearby government hospital for a medico-legal case. The law doesn’t allow the victim to get ‘first’ treatment from a private health facility, because ‘incorrect or incomplete’ medico-legal reports may trigger a pause or delay in legal proceedings, he explained. Regarding the formation of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), the Punjab police were of the opinion it would be premature to form a JIT before even lodging the case. In response to a question about the ‘other shooters’ involved in the armed attack on the container in Wazirabad, the police officer said it would be premature to say anything conclusive as the investigations were yet to be started. A senior police officer told Dawn that a set of blunders had been noticed by the law enforcement agencies while examining the footage of the crime scene recoded by a dozen of CCTV cameras. The biggest of the blunders was the security lapse that must be put on the priority in the starting phase of investigations into the incident, he said. He said the huddle also discussed that a further delay in the registration of a case could spoil all efforts to secure evidence and punish the suspects involved in the armed attack on Mr Khan’s container in Wazirabad. In a statement that spurned Islamabad’s effort to defuse tensions, New Delhi described PM Imran’s statement that Pakistan itself has been the biggest victim of terrorism as “far from the truth”. He also targeted the Congress for its attack on the government over the Pulwama suicide bombing. “It is sad to see a few people speaking in the language of Pakistan while residing in India. These are the same people who will visit Pakistan and request them to do anything to overthrow the Modi government,” he said. Here, Dawn.com takes a look back at the chain of events that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war and raised international alarm about the stability of the subcontinent. India’s opposition Congress party echoed criticism of PM Modi that he was using the Pulwama tragedy for electoral gains and asked him to own moral responsibility for the intelligence failure in the killing of paramilitary men by a home-grown suicide bomber. Read: Experts question India’s claim of destroying militant camp near LoC “We are not surprised that the prime minister of Pakistan refuses to acknowledge the attack on our security forces in Pulwama as an act of terrorism. Prime minister of Pakistan has neither chosen to condemn this heinous act nor condoled with the bereaved families,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) complained. Modi didn’t name Pakistan but went on to say: “If our neighbour, which is totally isolated in the world and thinks it can destabilise India through its tactics and conspiracies, then it is making a huge mistake”. The same day Indian Acting Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia was handed a protest note over the allegations levelled by Indian officials against Pakistan. Foreign Minister Qureshi wrote a letter to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) president, drawing his attention to what he called a “deteriorating security situation” in the region resulting from Indian rhetoric in the wake of the Pulwama attack. The strained relations between India and Pakistan made their way to sports as well with the broadcast of the Pakistan Super League 2019 being blocked in India."

But Gandhi claimed that in some cases patriotic fervour was being forced on people, referring to a widely circulated video showing a shopkeeper in Haryana state scolding a customer who came in for free grain and did not want to buy a flag. Gandhi said nationalism could never be sold. “Along with the tricolour, the BJP government is also attacking the self-esteem of the poor of our country,” he wrote on Facebook. An analyst, Parsa Ventakteshwar Rao Jr, said: “Since Modi’s party has appropriated patriotism as part of its ideology, it doesn’t miss any chance to link itself with a patriotic occasion. What is left unsaid is that this patriotism is Hindu patriotism.” In some Delhi neighbourhoods, residents’ welfare associations have taken it upon themselves to enforce the flying of the flag. When some residents on a WhatsApp group said it should be left to personal choice because some people did not want to follow Modi’s demands, an association president said: “It has nothing to do with personal choice. It is a matter of national honour and respect.” The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party rules at national as well as at state level in Haryana. Other critics of Narendra Modi’s government said students, shopkeepers, housing associations and companies had been pressured by government supporters to display the flag.

She is among several Muslims in India who have been arrested or detained for supporting Pakistan in the recent match - raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the world's largest democracy. Observers argue that these arrests are the latest weapon in the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) agenda to target Muslim minorities, a charge the government strongly denies. ""None of these have any substance to them. They are just issues to whip up anti-Muslim passions which, sadly seem to be widespread,"" he argued. And relations are particularly tense in  Indian-administered Kashmir, where an insurgency against Indian rule has been under way since the late 1980s. ""What the police have done is absolutely wrong.

But a senior Indian government spokesperson said it was ""preposterous"" for anyone to say that taking action against a very small number of Muslims amounted to penalising the millions of people who belong to the faith in the country. In a video which has surfaced online, a man, allegedly former BJP lawmaker Vikram Randhawa, can be heard saying the students should be ""skinned alive"" and have their degrees and citizenship cancelled for raising pro-Pakistan slogans on Indian soil.

The video shows people waving the flag of a political party in the southern Indian state of Kerala, not Pakistan's national flag.

Leaders of other minority denominations spoke out against the divisive CAA. Prominent among them were the National Council of Churches in India (NCCI) and the Evangelical Fellowship of India (EFI). The NCCI said that the Act polarised communities and contravened the fundamental principles of the Constitution. The EFI expressed concern at the “terrifying impact” of the amendments that threatened to radically change the status of a large number of Indian citizens. In a strongly worded statement, the EFI said: “The breaking of covenants that the Constitution and founding fathers of the nation had made with the people began with Kashmir, took the course of the NRC and the Citizens Amendment Bill (CAB), and now we have the threats to do away with the two seats reserved for Anglo-Indians in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies.” Apart from the Christian minority organisations, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which had supported the Bill in Parliament, had already spoken out against the CAA and the NRC. The protests initially were confined to the north-eastern States when the dubious connection between the CAA and the NRC began to unfold. The BJP tried to play it down as a minor hurdle, assuaging its north-eastern constituents, especially in Assam, that their concerns would be addressed in the legislation. The “minority-majority” binary that the BJP sought to create did not work. The Bill amending the Citizenship Act, 1955, was passed, despite the message that it was a highly socially divisive and sectarian one. But the game plan fell apart as protests spilled over from one State to the other, with widespread participation from all communities, including those that stood to benefit from the sectarian CAA. The CAA provides for the legalisation and naturalisation of citizenship of illegal migrants from Hindu, Christian, Jain, Parsi, Sikh and Buddhist communities who, as religious minorities, had fled persecution from three countries, namely, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Apart from being openly sectarian andultra vires of the Constitutionvis-a-vis the core principle of equality of all persons, the Bill conveniently ignored the claims of many other refugees from other neighbouring countries who had made India their home. “It’s kind of the Wild West,” Thornberg said. “I have just largely dismissed this data.” The bogus applications have combined with large backlogs and miscounts to make unemployment benefit data, a key economic indicator, a less-reliable measure of the nation’s job market. The biggest threat is posed by sophisticated international fraud rings that often use stolen identities to apply for benefits, filling out the forms with a wealth of accurate information that enables their applications to “sail through the system,” said Michele Evermore, an expert on jobless aid at the National Employment Law Project. Other state unemployment agencies have been bedeviled by fraud during the crisis."

A PIL had also been filed in Delhi High Court in this regard in 2016 where the then Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain had submitted a declaration saying that the policy of euthanizing the animals was being amended and that the dogs will be rehabilitated. Also read: No, the Indian Army does not kill its dogs after retirement What makes the memorial unique is that it is devoted to service animals, mostly dogs, but also horses and mules. It will be the country’s first animal war memorial and recognise heroics on the battlefield, devotion to duty and outstanding contribution to military service alongside soldiers, three senior officers said, asking not to be named. “It will be a befitting token of remembrance and a mark of respect and gratitude towards the RVC soldiers (men and animals) who laid down their lives for the country. Several western nations have memorials dedicated to animals,” said the second officer. “Approval from the defence ministry is expected soon to construct a war memorial to commemorate RVC animals and men who have sacrificed their lives or have been commended for exceptional gallantry or distinguished service. Land has already been identified in Meerut and the preliminary design has been frozen,” said one of the officers. Labradors, German Shepherds and Belgian Shepherds (Malinois) are the mainstay of the army’s canine work force. The RVC has introduced some Mudhol Hounds (an indigenous dog breed from Karnataka) and Cocker Spaniels on a trial basis for explosives detection. Indian Generals may not be battle hardened but they are no fools……….Neither General Bipin Rawat, not any other General will dare utter a single word against China………Their careers &  post retirement perks are  at stake & they know it well !!! The report does not make it clear if the Chinese movement is within territory controlled by China or India. However, sources in the know maintain that there is no transgression here per se, even though troop build-up has taken place on the Chinese side. How india expect no reaction if it tries to access to karakuram highway, which is CPEC lifeline.  Dont forget Pakistan already there.  India has to remain like a state not savage, in order to remain a state.  Or face if from all ots neighbours. How india expect no reaction if it tries to access to karakuram highway, which is CPEC lifeline.  Dont forget Pakistan already there.  India has to remain like a state not savage, in order to remain a state. I don’t see any issue so long as Chinese are on their side and we are on ours. Any number does not matter and we should match the Chinese man for man and machine for machine. Chinese should know by now that we are there in full strength and any nonsense will be repulsed. While usual military and diplomatic consultations should and must continue, we need to hold on like we did at Dokhlam. Our press should not sensationalize the issue  and follow the Dokhlam type forbearance in reporting. We are sure that Indian Army will handle it well on the ground. Sources told ThePrint that the Chinese have not crossed the CCL in these areas, but did accept that these areas are about 3 km within India’s perception of the LAC. Yeah… very embarrassing that Hindu Modi has to impose curfew to visit Jammu and Kashmir. Your rogue military can only kill unarmed Kashmiris. Chinese forces broke their legs, necks and arms in Ladakh without firing a single shot, by beating them to pulp with nail-studded iron rods. Pakistani forces do not use drone and tanks against own people. But even if they do, at least they are not killing non-Muslims, just you Hindus defend Hindu terror sena for killing Muslim Kashmiris in world’s biggest democracy.

PLA & CPC tantrums at borders did not make any difference to Modi gov decision making. Talking about Kashmir, kindly remember “ethnic cleansing” in post independent India happened in only one place – the Kashmir valley where what you call the poor freedom fighters drove away half a million minority Kashmiri Hindus through violence, threats and rapes in 1990’s and thus removed from Kashmir valley the minorities. No systematic ethnic cleansing happened in any part of post independent India even in a village. These people had not done anything apart from following a religion different from Islam and apparently this was a crime in the eyes of the “poor freedom fighters”. The Indian army was deployed only after this and not before. This is a fact and a matter of record. After his retirement as the Eastern Army Commander last year, he has been serving as the military adviser in the National Security Council Secretariat headed by NSA Ajit Doval. Tail piece: Don’t give anything to a soldier. Respect him. It costs nothing. He will give you all that he has. Also read: Indian tourists can keep the Chinese away from LAC. Govt must open borders At a second level, the government, in turn, needs to tell the Services what it actually expects from them. For instance, military exercises that envisage a drive deep into Pakistan are never going to happen, not under a nuclear overhang. Do we need to be ready to ‘get back the whole of Kashmir’? No, nobody wants it. Besides, we can’t deal with the slice we have. A rationalisation of tasking helps to pare down the list of acquisition to what you need, versus all those goodies you’re never going to get. The newly created Department of Military Affairs could focus on cutting out the flab in expectations. The numbers will then come down by themselves. If the Army can not be adequately equipped then it should stand down rather than face one sided destruction. You know nothing my dear .Am from secret service ,just stumbled seeing your incomplete truth about India’s modern warfare ecosystem…Just keep in mind you only know what you are shown in media,news channels..We have 5 th generation warfare program which is confidential.So stop scaremongering because you are getting this update from a Defence officer.. However we are planning to showcase these things in expo. First, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence’s hearings over the years are replete with gallant Service officers telling the panel that they would still manage India’s defence no matter what. That’s admirable, but someone, either the Service chiefs or a group of retired senior service officers, need to tell the hard facts to the government. Can we actually fight a two-front war? And as the PSCOD notes, our equipment is not enough for more than 10 days of hard fighting, presumably along one front. These and other ‘ifs and buts’ need to be made clear to the government. Consider the Pentagon reaction to defence cuts under Barack Obama. The 2012 National Defense Strategy said the US’ Department of Defense would make “clear distinctions both among the key sizing and shaping missions… and between these mission areas and all other areas of the defense program”. That was a clear message — as manpower was being reduced, the department could not and would not be able to fulfil everything Congress demanded of it. By all means, tell them what you can do. But also tell them what you can’t."

The video is viral in the backdrop of the soon-to-be conducted MP by-polls which will see voting on 28 Assembly seats, of which 25 have been lying vacant after the resignation of the then Congress MLAs. The 25 MLAs who had resigned from the party had later joined Bharatiya Janata Party along with former Member of Parliament Jyotiraditya Scindia. Read more about the MP by-polls here. This and several other old videos from Madhya Pradesh have been revived and shared out of context in the run up to the by-polls.

The Facebook post can be seen here, the post is archived here. BOOM has chosen not to include the post as the contents are explicit in nature. Below is a screenshot of the viral post. This article is an embarrassing commentary on the editorial insight of ‘The print’.       Of all the things they decide to provide a platform to an ignorant Islamic apologist who doesn’t even know the difference between ‘Religion’ and ‘Dharma’. First of all your biggest mistake is to mistakenly interpret “Dharm” as “religion”. Yogeshwar Bhagwan Sri Krishna meant Dharm with bound responsibility. The biggest disappointment is that the meaning of “Jihad” is also different but unfortunately “Al-Qaeda, jamat-ud-dawa, lashkar etc are putting that into wrong structure and brainwashing illiterate individuals. Why pick on Hindus and Christians ? Why we are all Kafirs according to them? The translation of the Gita shloka given in this article is completely wrong. To understand what is intended to be conveyed, the sanskrit terms in the shkoka need to analysed by understanding the associated philology. This translation is very shabbily done without the due homework. Nhi sach kadwa hota hai par yeh sach toh bole. They misinterpreted meaning of dharma in sanskrit and hindi. Sanskrit word dharm means righteousness  and hindi word dharma means religion. The print people are islamist and who haven’t evn read sanskrit so how can they say. Clearly there is some language problem,  either while writing it or while translating it or understanding it or explaining it! something somewhere has seriously gone wrong !!just like you mis understood dharma as religion when in reality Dharma is duty and not religion! ! This is not the kind of journalism one expects to see in such a reputed media company as ‘The Print’. I request you to revise the article, or take it down completely. It is true that in comparison to other religions, Islam has radical and dangerous ideologies. It is true that Islam needs reform. But that does not mean it deserves hate. The very fact that examples from the Qu’ran depicting violence are plentiful while examples from The Gita and Bible are very little, not to mention mistranslated and misinterpreted go to prove this. The headline alone is blatantly false, and shows like Mohammed, you failed to understand covenants. Notice you said “Bible and Torah”. Are you dumb? The Holy Bible is a compilation of the Torah and the Gospels. So where in the Gospels (covenant of Christ) does Jesus tell his followers to slay those who mock him? See, this is why Mohammed is a laughably pathetic false prophet, trying to namedrop Jesus for authenticity, yet clearly didn’t understand or read ANYTHING Jesus taught and instead just adopted some non-canon Gospel of Infancy of Jesus the Christ from 400 AD-ish.Also, I like how you point out how the context isn’t in the Quran…. unlike the Torah and Gospels which are THIRD PERSON CHRONICLE FORMAT. written by human WITNESSES. While the Quran claims to be first person eternal commands written BY Allah – AND transmitted antirely to Jibril on the first night, who then would release it peacemeal conveniently when Mohammed broke his own rules, these pre-ordained rules seem to excuse him from very specific situations. So clearly context isn’t important, it would have been included. What you’re doing is tantamount to the Tootsi Frootsie Ice Cream skit in Marx Bros’ Day at the Races Dear The Print,Please try to modify the title of this article and issue a corrigendum if possible.  I do like the content of The Print, esp ‘Cut the Clutter’, but this is gross misunderstanding on the part of the author and is simply spreading misinformation. Even an uninitiated Hindu like myself knows that the word ‘Dharma’ as used in scriptures does not at all mean ‘Religion’ as is being made out in this article.  A word similar to ‘religion’ did not exist till about the end of the midieval period, and is essentially a foreign concept. I believe the closes word(s) to ‘religion’ in Sansktrit would be ‘panth’ or ‘sampraday’ (but then again I’m no expert in etymology of Indic languages nor history). Now, this ill-defined article will continue to spread such misinformation which is not what I expect from The Print.Doing what is right, and what is one’s duty is more important than anything else, and in the context of Mahabhrata and Kurushetra war, it had to come about by Arjuna (and Pandavas) going against thier beloved brothers, friends, elders and Gurus who sided with adharma. Simple as it may sound, this is fundamentally both relevant as well as difficult to grasp, practice and preach in the modern real world, especially where the lines between ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma’ are blurred, and can be applied on all kinds of simple to complex  (‘brain-freezing’) problems faced by humankind such as voting for someone to recommending someone for something.In the same vein, I took it as my dharma to at least point out the gross inaccuracies in this article, and expect you to as well do your dharma despite the odds (brothers, friends, compulsions) you may face. Quran incites a lot of hatred and violence directly against polytheists and idol worshipers – read Hindu. It is scientifically incorrect and is said to be revealed text – word of god. Very sorry to say that you are not intellectually honest and this is Article is Taqiya what a bullshit article by THE PRINT? do you people think, you are modern? by reading this stereotype artice, the respect for journalism really goes down. by the way your elite journalism really waste.  hypocratic. There are many things, in Sushant’s case,  have gone wrong. The handling of this case by the Police of two states, the media trial and making Rhea a villain by media. All these things should not happen. Making Rhea a stereotypical  villain is so so wrong.Writer has written how Bengali women are stereotyped in a song. But what the writer of this article is doing is no different from what is happening with Rhea. Calling a certain region cow belt and families of the region toxic. I am amazed by the hypocrisy of the writer.Most of us don’t know Sushant, Rhea or Sushant’s family. Wihtout investigation, if calling for Rhea’s head is utmost stupidity. Then what would you call the action of the writer who call Sushant’s relationship with his family toxic. Rhea was not the first girl in Sushant’s life. He had a long relationship with Ankita Lokhande. She is also a big city modern actress. We have seen many of her interviews. The way she talks about Sushant’s family is there to be seen. The wirter should also watch those interviews. Ankita might have lost touch with Sushant but was still is in touch with Sushant’s family. She calls Sushant’s father Papa and his sister didi. I don’t know how a family has so much love for one girl and same family became toxic to another. Writer and the Print should be careful what they are publishing. If calling a region and some states “cow-belt” comes under the definition of being modern and liberal, I don’t know what bigotry and biased views are! How would you feel if someone called you “Milkmaid” judging from your surname?Stop passing judgements on the basis of few facts. Little knowledge is dangerous.Media trials are wrong, whether done by paid media houses on television, or so called ‘free’ media such as yourselves. So stop tarnishing the name of any person, family or region. Focus on real journalism This is an article which has been written with pre-conceived notions, stereotypes, judgements along with a click baity headline which shows the inherent bias and hate of this author for Bihar. What is wrong with journalism now adays…. This article is full of hypocrisy and biased. Felt like reading a feminist article. Please get your facts right before you pursue any kind of journalism! It can clearly be seen that you are biased in what you write about. Please do justice atleast to your own profession, let alone Sushant Singh Rajput.  Your “print” is highly misleading for people who may have just started hearing for the first time about who SSR is and what happened to him.  This piece of news is not the truth.  Please refer to more creditable newspapers like The Times of India for factual information and some inspiration, if I may, to understand what truth actually looks like. I am wondering hie did this piece of crap slipped out under the editorial scrutiny of Shekhar Gupta! Utterly nonsense, parochial and biased idea. Not expected from The Print! This irresponsible “opinion” from your end really shows the disgraceful journalism practices in India.Maybe next time,  base opinions on hard facts and not pseudo feminist agendas. To point out the shortcomings in a society is one thing, but to be inconsiderate and condescending while doing  so is not responsible journalism. What’s wrong with the writer??? This article is so shallow and insensitive. The writer is trying to generalise whole bihar and North India as backward and full with narrow minded people. And how can someone call ssr’s family a “toxic bihari familiy”. Dude this writer has some serious issues she is so hateful. At least get your facts write and try to be sensible.Still shocked how can The Print allow this kind of article and say “support our journalism”. Pathetic!!! Jamshedpur is a town of East Singhbhum known for steel industry of Tata Group. But East Singhbhum police rubbished the allegations as a bundle of blatant lies and misleading. News and opinion website that brings you reports and narrative from a perspective often ignored or suppressed by the mainstream media of India. On being contacted East Singhbhum SP Subhash Chandra Jat termed the allegation baseless, misleading and malicious. “Nothing has come out in the inquiry. There is no shred of truth in this,” said SP. They alleged that they were beaten and threatened to be sent to Afghanistan and that they were asked to strip naked for gay sex and their religion was abused. They claimed the policemen made derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad. The officer in-charge declined to give any clarification. “Since they have leveled allegations against me I should not comment. Kadma police station is situated in the heart of Jamshedpur and such kinds of things can’t go undetected. This is an attempt to create communal frenzy,” said Thakur. Some claimed that Muslims in India do not have legal recourse. Two Muslim youths Mohammad Arzoo and Mohammad Aurangzeb from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand accused East Singhbhum police for forcing them into gay sex and insulting Islam after being questioned in a criminal case on August 26. The news was reported in a website called ‘MuslimMirror’."

Mastercard, Visa and Discover all terminated their cards from being used on it. The Canadian-based website jabbed other social media websites, writing that “every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders, a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute.” Pornhub has yet to respond to our requests for comment regarding the removal and reinstatement of its Instagram page but a spokesperson said in an email to CTV News that the platform has ""zero tolerance for illegal content and investigates any complaint or allegation made about content on our platforms.""

Reports say Hilal is responsible for the quick delivery of the Rafale fighter aircraft and its weaponising as per Indian conditions. The officer, who was seen with India's ambassador to France during the takeoff of Rafale jets, hails from the Bakshiabad area of south Kashmir's Anantnag district. According to sources, he studied at the Sanik School. He has also said to have won Sword of Honour in NDA. By Shuja-ul-Haq : It took four years for India's first batch of five Rafale jets to take off from France. One of the key persons in this whole process has been Air Commodore Hilal Ahmad Rather, who is India’s air attaché to France. The French air and space force is participating with Rafale, Airbus A-330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), A-400M Tactical Transport aircraft and approximately 175 personnel. The first squadron of Light Combat Aircraft, Tejas, was raised in 2016. Widowmaker is even worse, not just because of the insensitivity towards wives of fighter pilots, but because there are women fighter pilots now part of the Indian Air Force who could be flying the MiG 21. Former Air Force Chief, BS Dhanoa, who himself was a MiG 21 pilot, says, “Do you see a 1963 car on the streets?” Fighter aircraft like Jaguar, MiG 29, and Mirage are also ageing, having been inducted in the 1980s. We certainly don’t want them to go the MiG 21 way. The IAF has finally got 36 Rafale jets that are currently the most modern in its fleet and this was possible only when procedures were compromised. This was an emergency procurement against the IAF’s almost 20-year requirement of 114 fighter jets that still stands. In the mid-1970s, the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) completed a study on an indigenous fighter aircraft but the plan could not fructify. It was in 1983, when the IAF felt that an Indian aircraft would be needed in years to come and finally in 1984 there was some hope. The government set up the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and that’s when the idea of a Light Combat Aircraft was born. Parrikar saw in the Tejas a ticket to India's fighter aircraft self-sufficiency. He chaired nearly 20 meetings between all stakeholders in the national effort to build a lightweight supersonic fighter that would fill the void left by the fast-depleting MiG-21 squadrons. The participants included HAL, ADA (Aeronautical Development Agency) and the IAF. The IAF felt that Tejas Mark-1 was underpowered, short-legged and lacked an effective radar and sensor suite. It wanted ADA, the DRDO's aircraft design agency, to upgrade the Tejas to a more capable LCA Mark-2, powered by new GE-414 engines. ADA has switched to a bouquet of fighter aircraft programmes, with the fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) and Twin Engine Deck-Based Fighter (TEDBF) to replace the navy's MiG-29Ks. The project closest to induction is the LCA Mark-2, briefly called the Medium Weight Fighter (MWF). The extensive redesign and a new engine have created a far more capable aircraft in the Mirage-2000 category. The aircraft was designed in consultation with the IAF to avoid the pitfalls of the LCA Mark-1 project, in which scientists and the IAF worked in silos. ""For MWF, we sat down with the IAF every month to understand their requirements,"" says Deodhare. The biggest change in HAL has been outsourcing. From building all components in-house and then assembling them, it wisely outsourced component-building to the private sector. All five major sections of an aircraft are built by private firms spread across south India. Dynamatic Technologies builds the front fuselage, L&T builds the wings, VEM Technologies the centre fuselage and Alpha-Tocol Engineering Services the rear fuselage. The tail and rudder are built by the National Aerospace Laboratories and Tata Advanced Materials. HAL puts together these sections at its Bengaluru production line, integrates the engine and avionics and rolls out the aircraft. Delivering the 83 Tejas aircraft will require a huge change of approach for HAL, the country's only fighter aircraft-maker. For over half a century, the organisation has mainly done licensed production, an arrangement under which Russian, French and British aircraft firms gave HAL the knowhow to assemble aircraft from knockdown kits. Now, HAL will have to master the technology of indigenous production. ""In licensed production, you are told what to do. In indigenous production, you have to find out what to do,"" says Girish Deodhare, director of the Bengaluru-based ADA. The project was at a crossroads in the first term of the Narendra Modi government. The IAF did not want the jet in its existing form, but that required convincing Parrikar first. Parrikar, whose firm had once supplied for a DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) project, was an enthusiastic votary of India developing indigenous defence capability. Here was a technocrat who could slip into the nuts and bolts of weapon acquisitions. None of this would have happened without a concerted push in 2016 when the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar stepped in to rescue the Tejas from being perpetually trapped in a development cycle. The project had begun as a concept during Indira Gandhi's rule in the early 1980s. The aircraft made its first flight in 2001, during prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure. It was designed as a fourth-generation multirole fighter, one of the world's smallest and lightest supersonic aircraft with a combat radius of 500 km and eight hard points that can carry 5.3 tonnes of weapons and sensors. Behind this long-delayed fighter aircraft project is the story of a rare political foresight that could lead to the creation of an indigenous aircraft ecosystem in the country. The IAF, too, has finally come on board to back the programme. In 2017, a presentation to the government by the then IAF chief, Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa, committed the IAF to buying 18 squadrons of the LCA and its variants-over 300 aircraft-over the next 15 years. IAF officials say the LCA family fits into their plans to reduce the diversity of fighter aircraft to just four by 2035-the other three being Sukhoi, Rafale and Mirage-2000.

Hence now India is safe heaven for Terrorist and not Pakistan.US Scholar Christine Fair Says: Indian Air Force Did Not Shoot Down Pak F-16 in Balakot Aftermath,An Indian Air Force pilot found himself in a dogfight last week (on February 28 2019) with a warplane from the Pakistani Air Force, and ended up a prisoner behind enemy lines for a brief time.The pilot made it home in one piece, however bruised and shaken, but the plane, an aging Soviet-era MiG-21, was less lucky.The aerial clash, the first by the South Asian rivals in nearly five decades, was a rare test for the Indian military — and it left observers a bit dumbfounded (make somebody temporarily speechless). While the challenges faced by the India’s armed forces are no secret, its loss of a plane last week to a country whose military is about half the size and receives a quarter of the funding was still telling.(Bloomberg) — India’s statement that its air force shot down one of Pakistan’s U.S.-built F-16 aircraft during a military flare up in late February appears untrue, according to a report by Washington, D.C.-based Foreign Policy magazine, which cited two U.S. defense officials it didn’t identify.Fair, a professor of security studies at Georgetown University who has spent many years researching in Pakistan, stirred up a heated debate at the Military Literature Festival in Chandigarh on Saturday when she went on to assert that she did not believe India shot down an F-16 fighter during the dogfight between Indian and Pakistani jets in the aftermath of the Indian airstrikes over Balakot.She, however, questioned the IAF’s narrative about the incident, saying that it is not based on an empirical body of facts but dictated more by “things deployed by politicians to win elections…. The world outside of India does not see things the way they were said here today.

Hence now India is safe heaven for Terrorist and not Pakistan. Such was the secrecy that even though the aircraft flew out of the Gwalior base, which falls under Central Air Command, the AOC-in-C of the Command was not aware of the ops until just a few hours before the fighters actually took off. “When the Mirages were nearing the LoC, the Pakistani SAAB AWACS, which was in the air, seemed to have picked up the fighters and two Pakistani aircraft was scrambled,” Air Marshal Kumar said. Its funny that Pakistan never mentions Wing Commander Shahzaz Ud Din, who lost his life. After all its Pakistan who doesnt take soldiers bodies in Kargil or leave its students to die in Wuhan To fir tere gafure ko dard kyu hua….27 ko kyu apne jet LC pe bheje…kyu gafoora uchal ke bola ki do jet giraye..do pilot captured…dusra kaha gya ..apni khala ke ghar..teri sarkar or army ne aaj tak kabhi sach bola he….history me bhi 1971 ka war tum jeete as per ur govt theory fir bangladesh kese bana….93000 fauji jo yaha delhi meerut road bana kar gye vo kon the…hai koi jawab. They flew towards Bareilly and tanked up mid-air, then headed towards Jammu and Kashmir. If not 300 or 299 or whatever the figure is humne uske unka pind daan karna hai kya? Unke gotra ka bhi pata karen I suggest you christian the Rafales to the Hindu name of “Abhinandan” because it was his sacrifice that forced the honest  Indian establishment to ignore the corruption scandals in the Rafale deal and go ahead with purchasing them. After all the Pakistani Airforce bit IAF so hard that they went “Helter Skelter,” to purchase these jets. If however the MIG 21 Bison was so good a slayer of F16s then what was the need?????????????????????????????????????? “At about 1800 hours, the Air Force chief called me and asked if I was ready. We both knew that the government would not take this audacious attack lying down. I replied saying that I was ready,” said Air Marshal Kumar, who was the then Air Officer Commanding in Chief (AOC-IN-C) of the critical Western Air Command and was scheduled to retire that month-end after turning 60. Currently, Indian Air Force has Sukhoi 30 MKIs, Mirage 2000s, MiG-29s and the ageing Jaguars and MiG 21 Bisons in its inventory of fighter jets. In the proposal copies, it is mentioned that to acquire the additional MiG-29s from Russia, there will be modifications in the existing contract for MiG-29 upgrades. The MiG-29s is a twin-engine jet fighter aircraft designed to shoot enemy aircrafts in short and beyond-visual range and are significantly lighter than Sukhoi-30 MKIs.

In September 2016, India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 Rafale jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore to strengthen the IAF's combat capabilities. As per the deal, the delivery of the first four Rafale fighter jets were scheduled to arrive in India by May 2020, but their delivery has to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic as aircraft manufacturer Dassault's assembly facility in Merignac were closed due to the spread of virus in the country. BOOM contacted the Indian Air Force and confirmed that Rather is at present India's Air Attache to France, and he was not piloting the fighter jet to India. According to news reports, Air Commodore Rather saw off the first batch of five Rafale jets which took off from France on July 27. We were however unable to independently verify whether or not Commodore Hilal Ahmed Rather has previously piloted a Rafale fighter jet. BOOM went through through several news article reporting on the Rafale jets being flown to India, none of which mentions anything about IAF officer Rather flying one of the jets to India. Viral posts claiming that Air Commodore Hilal Ahmed Rather flew one of the five Rafale jets - the first batch of which reached India from France on July 29 - are false. BOOM also contacted the Indian Air Force to get more details. IAF spokesperson Indranil Nandi confirmed that Air Commodore Hilal Ahmed Rather had not flown one of the Rafale fighter jets to India. ""Air Commodore Hilal Ahmed Rather is India's Air Attache in France. He did not fly one of the jets,"" the IAF spokesperson told BOOM. A Hindi caption with the viral post translates to 'Hilal who flew Rafale. This is Air Commodore Hilal Ahmed Rather, a native of Kashmir. He is flying the first Rafale fighter jet to India. Hailing from South Kashmir's Anantnag has finished his studies from Sainik School. He joined Indian Air Force in 1988. Before this Hilal has flown MIG-21, Mirage 2000 and Kiran aircraft. He is the recipient of VayuSena medal and Vishisht Seva medal'. Read Video Of Rafale Jet's Solo Display In Austrian Airshow Shared As India BOOM also found old videos of a Rafale jet performing mid-air maneuvering viral with captions claiming that Air Commodore Rather was at the pilot seat of the fighter jet on way to India. A Hindi caption with the viral video translates to 'Five Rafale fighter jets arrive in India. Just see the swag of Rafale and pilot Hilal Ahmed'. BOOM found that the posts use photos from 2019 when a Mirage 2000 jet crashed in Bengaluru and a fake and morphed screenshot of the official IAF Twitter handle is being used to add authenticity to the false claim. Photos from 2019 when a Mirage aircraft crashed in Bengaluru are being shared with the false claim that a Rafale jet crashed in Ambala during training. The photos are viral with a screenshot of a morphed tweet falsely claiming the information was tweeted by the official handle of the Indian Air Force. The fake claim is viral days after India inducted five Rafale jets to the Indian Air Force's 17 Squadron 'Golden Arrows' at the IAF's Ambala base. The aircrafts were inducted in the presence of Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and French Minister of Armed Forces Florence Parly.The posts are viral on Twitter and Facebook with a set of four images - One image showing a Rafale jet while three of the aftermath of a plane crash. The images are being shared with the caption: Breaking news: one Rafale jet crash during training. 2 pilots dead, Modi ji When you can't fly it, why did you buy it? (Original text Modi jee jb chala nh skte tou khareeday kio?) BOOM found out that the viral images are from February 2019 when a Mirage 2000 jet crashed in Bengaluru and that the screenshot of the tweet being shared is morphed and the official Twitter handle of the IAF never tweeted such an update. BOOM checked the Indian Air Force's Twitter account, @IAF_MCC for any tweets about a reported crash involving a Rafale jet on September 4 but did not find any such update or tweet. We then contacted a spokesperson of the Indian Air Force who directed us to a tweet by the Press Information Bureau's fact checking unit who had debunked the same fake claim. You can view the PIB tweet here. Breaking news: one Rafale jet crash during training.2 pilots dead, Modi jee jb chala nh skte tou khareeday kio?🙏#rafale_india_crashed#IndianArmy #RafaleInduction pic.twitter.com/CeA4ZZk09V While scrolling through the Twitter thread, BOOM found this video of the jet's smoking engine. We also ran a Twitter advanced search using the IAF's Twitter handle and failed to find any replies to any such deleted tweet by the account on the mentioned date and time -- 11.33 pm on September 4, 2020, in the viral screenshot. We further searched for news about an Indian Air Force Rafale jet crashing but did not find any news articles about such a crash. Therefore, the photos being shared as a crashed Rafale aircraft are firstly from an old crash and are also not even of a Rafale, but a Mirage 2000. Firstly, we checked for news reports and found no such news of a crash of a Rafale aircraft. Therefore, it is clear that old photos of an IAF Mirage 2000 fighter jet crash in Bengaluru are being shared falsely as a new Rafale crash during a training session. Two pilots died after the Mirage 2000 trainer fighter aircraft of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) crashed at the HAL Airport in Bengaluru. The test pilots were identified as Squadron leader Siddharth Negi and Squadron leader Samir Abrol. However, the photo showing the intact aircraft on a runway is actually of a Rafale aircraft. The photo is from 29 July, when the first batch of five Rafale aircraft from France arrived in India, landing at the Air Force Station at Ambala. The Twitter handle of the Indian Air Force had shared the photos after the landing. However, no such crash has occurred and we found that the photos being used to make this claim are from a crash of a Mirage 2000 in Bengaluru in February 2019. “Breaking news: one Rafale jet crash during training. 2 pilots dead (sic),” the message being shared with the photos said. The tweet also used several hashtags connected to the Indian Army, Air Force and the induction of the Rafale aircraft. The claim is arising in the aftermath of the formal induction of the Rafale into the Indian Air Force (IAF) at the Air Force Station in Ambala on Thursday, 10 September. One Rafale jet crashed during formal induction in Ambala. Therefore, the photos show a Mirage 2000 and not a Rafale aircraft, unlike the viral claims. Claim:An alleged tweet by @IAF_MCC claims that a combat aircraft Rafale jet has crashed near Ambala Airbase due to technical fault and a pilot is martyred#PIBFactCheck: The image is #Morphed. No such tweet has been posted by IAF.

On September 10, the Indian Air Force formally inducted the Rafale fighter jets at the Ambala airbase in the presence of the Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart Florence Parly. According to a Times of India report, two pilots lost their lives on February 1, 2019, after the Mirage 2000 trainer fighter aircraft of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) crashed at the HAL Airport in Bengaluru. The pilots were identified as Squadron leader Siddharth Negi and Squadron leader Samir Abrol.

Khan also denied being appointed an advisor to Biden. Speaking to BOOM, he said, ""The claims in the viral tweet are false. I have not been currently appointed as a political advisor. It seems that some overambitious persons may have mistook some old information for current and shared on their social media which I was made aware via numerous people sharing those tweets with me."" Further, BOOM could not find Khan's name on the Biden-Harris presidential transition team, or in an update on his appointment as an advisor from its recent releases. An archived version of the list of its agency review teams can be found here. Evidently, social media users have falsely claimed that Khan was appointed as Biden’s political advisor. Khan confirmed to The Quint’s WebQoof team that the claims were false and he hadn’t been asked to be a political advisor to Biden at the time of publishing this article. (Translation: “Big News: The New President of USA, Joe Biden has appointed Ahmad Khan of Indian origin as his political advisor. It is worth mentioning that Ahmed Khan is an Indian, he belongs to Hyderabad.”) Joe Biden has appointed Ahmed Khan of Indian origin as his political advisor. The man in the image is indeed Ahmed Khan however the viral claim is false. Alt News spoke with Ahmed who confirmed that he is a Chicago-based US citizen and has not been assigned the role of a political advisor by Biden. “If he came in fourth, yeah, that could hurt,” said Bill Freeman, a Biden donor from Nashville, Tennessee, who added that he hadn’t even considered such a possibility heading into Monday’s caucuses. “That’s a bad night, no matter how you spin it.” Still, Buttigieg and Klobuchar have their own challenges if they hope to displace Biden as the presumed establishment favorite. They both have negligible nonwhite support, and Klobuchar especially has far more financial obstacles than Biden. The problem, Freeman said, is that a lackluster start in Iowa makes the Biden-Sanders juxtaposition a much harder sell. “I don’t think any of those conversations are happening today” with potential new donors, he said. “Pakistan’s disappointment and concern were conveyed to the US envoy on the unwarranted remarks, which were not based on ground reality or facts. “This is not only irresponsible and unsafe but raises genuine and serious concerns about the safety of nuclear-capable countries,” he pointed out. Bilawal also said that he looked forward to seeing similar concern about India’s action to annex the internationally disputed territory of Kashmir which, according to him, was a complete violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions. Responding to a question, Bilawal said that PTI chief Imran Khan was a liar and it was the government’s responsibility to expose his reality in front of the nation. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also issued a strong response to Biden’s comments, saying that Pakistan’s record as a responsible nuclear power was “unimpeachable, and internationally attested to, unlike the existence of WMDs (weapons of mass destruction) in Iraq” — referring to US claims about the presence of WMDs in Iraq which were later debunked. “I am surprised by the remarks of President Biden […] I believe this is exactly the sort of misunderstanding that is created when there is a lack of engagement.” Bilawal criticised the PTI chief’s foreign policy, claiming that it created huge losses to the country and compromised Pakistan’s bilateral ties with friendly countries. The resolution called on countries not to recognise the four regions of Ukraine that Russia has claimed through referendums held under its occupation. He went on to say that Pakistan had nothing to do with Biden’s statement. “We will call their ambassador and issue a demarche, but I don’t think this was an official function […] it wasn’t an address to the parliament or an interview. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has rejected US President Joe Biden’s comments on Pakistan’s nuclear weapons as “factually incorrect and misleading”, according to a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on Saturday. Architectural designer rejected the advances of an influencer with two crucial words At Muzaffarnagar, Shah accused SP chief Akhilesh Yadav of telling “lies” on law and order, saying the BJP government had chased away criminals who flourished earlier. He said under the SP government everyone was afraid for their safety. “All goondas have now run away…. When Behenji’s party (BSP) came to power, it talked of one caste, the Congress talked of one family and Akhilesh ji of goondas, mafias and appeasement, but the BJP talks of security and development.” Urging voters not to make “the same mistake”, Shah said: “Otherwise those who instigated the riots will sit in the seat of power in Lucknow.” Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation fellow at the Wilson Center, said the ad pauses were needed but not sufficient for curbing the spread of viral lies. ""CNN, y’all trippin’ now,"" said Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) after anchor Erin Burnett asked if he had ""regrets"" over heckling the Republican. Democratic and Republican digital strategists railed against those decisions, saying the bans were overly broad and failed to combat a much bigger problem on the platforms: the organic spread of viral lies in unpaid posts. Bishal Malla said that Tesla was mostly unresponsive, but that one had the ""audacity"" to ask him to bring his ""fully burned Tesla"" in for servicing.

According to the description of the report, the Uttar Pradesh government had taken action against the police officials for their 'inhumane' behaviour toward the minor girl. The ABP News video can be seen below and similar reports on the same incident can be read here and here. Social media users have alleged hypocrisy on part of the Yogi Adityanath led Uttar Pradesh government. The Rediff News article is an interview with former Indian Police Service officer Kiran Bedi in July 2010, three months after a Maoist attack in the jungles of Dantewada in which 76 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers were martyred. Alt News performed a reverse image search on Google and found that the viral image was published on various websites over the years as a representative image including Rediff News in 2010, International Business Times (IBT) in 2014, and Euro News and The Quint in 2017. IBT and Rediff News credited the image to Reuters. The image caption on Rediff News mentioned at the end of the article reads, “CRPF personnel pay tribute to policemen who died in a Maoist attack in Dantewada.” PIB Kerala tweeted a video of the martyrs’ tribute ceremony by the Indian Army on November 13. The visuals of the tribute do not match the viral photograph.

This article had the whole image. The photo had the caption that image belonged to the funeral ceremony of CRPF personnel killed in Maoist attack on June 30, 2010. The image was attributed to Reuters. In 2010, Maoists attacked Bastar's Tadmetla area in which 75 CRPF personnel were killed along with a state policeman. The image of the funeral of those CRPF personnel is being shared by Pakistanis with the claim that it belongs to current ambush. Firstport had also shared the same image in the article published on August 15, 2013, about a constable receiving gallantry award posthumously for showing his bravery in Naxal attack in 2010. The Logical Indian did a reverse search image and found that the same image was published by Rediff.com on September 19, 2016, with the headline, ""Virat Kohli, Virendra Sehwag express their concern after Uri attack."" International organizations have also taken notice. Olivier De Schutter, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, visited the church earlier this month. He then sent the Belgian government a concerned letter, co-signed by his colleague Felipe González, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. De Schutter also met with Mahdi on July 12. “There is a trauma of migration issues in the way the previous government ended,” said Nina Hetmanska, a member of the support committee for the migrants and PhD assistant at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, one of the occupied universities. On Monday, several left-leaning Belgian political parties threatened to pull out of the current government if one of the strikers dies. The groups are also leaning on Prime Minister Alexander De Croo to take the issue away from Belgium’s migration and asylum chief, Sammy Mahdi, who for many weeks refused to yield to the strikers’ demands. On Monday, Mahdi appointed a neutral envoy from the Belgian central asylum authority to guide the hunger strikers through the existing application process. In light of the dire health situation, the strikers’ requests will be prioritized. “The problem … is that government officials do not know the profile of the strikers,” said Mohamed, 28, who said he came from Morocco in 2010 to study for a bachelor’s degree in biomedical science. If they did, Mohamed added, “they would quickly realize that they are people with potential, who know the country, who respect the values and principles of Belgium.” Once a local issue, the strikers gained global attention. A U.N. human rights official came to visit them. Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters is one of many famous musicians, artists and filmmakers to sign an open letter lobbying on their behalf. A famous French cultural festival featured pleas for awareness of the migrants’ plight. Mahdi has previously said the government made “mistakes” in 2000 and 2009 when it granted collective temporary residency permits to prior migrant occupations in Brussels. In 2018, then-Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel’s government collapsed after its largest coalition partner, the nationalist New Flemish Alliance, quit after the Belgian parliament backed a U.N. migration pact. These fissures are only growing. Last Thursday, Ecolo and the Francophone Socialists issued a joint open letter to the federal government, asking it to resolve the standoff with the hunger strikers and pleading for structural reform to the migration process. Asked whether quitting the government would spark a crisis, an Ecolo spokesperson said only, “discussions are underway. We are extremely focused on the next few hours, which will be very important.” The French-speaking Socialist Party and Ecolo, both left-leaning, want Mahdi stripped of authority over the protesting migrants. This week, the two parties even threatened to quit the coalition if there’s a death among the hunger strikers. Between them, the parties control seven of the coalition’s 20 ministers, giving them considerable — but not absolute — sway. RB: Perhaps not anymore, because they have designated Sirajuddin as a terrorist in their own 2012 order. KT: I don’t want to get lost in the detail of this section, but I think this section is very important because it explains the 20-25 year background of Pakistani support and involvement with the Taliban. However, let me now get to the present time. When the Taliban on the fifteenth of August literally dramatically swept into Kabul and took over, there are some people who say that that was the culmination of a second Pakistani invasion or conquest of Kabul. Once again fronted by the Taliban. You agreed that when the Taliban took power in 1996 this description applied. Does it apply again in 2021? KT: So that description, a Pakistani invasion fronted by the Taliban applied in 1996. You don’t think it applies equally in 2021. KT: Let me put this to you. It is reported that two Haqqani brothers, Khalil and Anis, are now responsible for security in Kabul today. If that’s true, then what does it suggest? KT: Let’s come very briefly to the situation in Afghanistan as it’s begun to emerge during the last 10-11 days. I believe the director general of the ISI flew to Kandahar when Mullah Baradar was there and they were seen together praying at a Mosque. There are also reports that Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi spent a day or two in Kabul, but he himself has denied it. What does all of this suggest about the role Pakistan is playing in helping put together a Taliban government? RB: Possibly. I mean, you have now an appointee, unless he has aligned now with the Haqqanis—Najibullah who has been appointed Intelligence Chief of this new government. And he was known to be closer to the Dadullah faction, which was not close to the Haqqanis in the old days. KT: Okay. Let me put this to you. On the very day that the Taliban entered and swept through Kabul, the fifteenth of August 2021, some of the most important leaders of the Northern Alliance, who were opponents of Pakistan, flew to Islamabad to seek safety, security and assurances from the Pakistan government. And these included Ahmad Shah Massoud’s brothers and important Hazara leaders like Khalili and Mohaqiq. If opponents of Pakistan are going to Pakistan to seek its support, sanctuary and safety, isn’t that a sure sign that Pakistan has become very important and very powerful in this part of the world? KT: So you could say that not only did Pakistan finance the first “conquest” of Kabul by the Taliban in ‘96, but then they in a sense provided the backbone for the government. KT: Let me at this point come to the second big issue I want to talk with you about. Until now we’ve talked about Pakistan’s role in funding, in training, in militarily supporting the Taliban right through the 25 years from 1995-96 to 2021. Let me now talk to you about the personalities and factions that make up the Taliban. Its present emir is a man called Hibatullah Akhundzada. What do we know about him, and why is he never seen? KT: Now the faction that is perhaps of great interest to India is what’s called the Haqqani faction. Tell me about them. The Haqqanis are often considered the brutal, tough fighting wing of the Taliban.

In November 2021, India’s then-Chief of Defence Staff stated in a press conference that China had become India’s biggest security threat (Sen 2021). Additionally, nearly all of India’s new Agni missiles have ranges that suggest China is their primary target. This posture is likely to have been reinforced after the 2017 Doklam standoff during which Chinese and Indian troops were placed on high alert over a dispute near the Bhutanese border. Tensions have remained high in subsequent years, particularly following another border skirmish in June 2020 that resulted in the deaths of both Chinese and Indian soldiers.

The missile may have been inducted into the armed forces in 2008, but technical issues delayed its operational capability until 2011. Around 10 launchers are thought to be deployed in northern India, possibly including the 335th Missile Group. Targeting is probably focused on western, central, and southern China. Although the Agni-II appeared to suffer from technical issues and failed several of its previous test launches, more recent successful tests in 2018 and 2019 indicate that previous technical issues could have since been resolved (Liu 2018; The Hindu 2019).

India should not advance its interests at the cost of others. Meanwhile, blaming Pakistan for terrorism or calling Pakistan a terrorist country is not a solution to their ever-lasting rivalry, but such attitudes can only cite hate among the citizens, further escalating bilateral rivalry. Pakistan has long extended its hand for negotiation, and the recently proposed Kartarpur Peace Corridor was another way to improve relations between countries. However, India’s choice to scuffle the special status of the undecided region of Kashmir in 2019 undermined the atmosphere for holding talks between India and Pakistan. The public support for joining NATO surged in both Finland and Sweden as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While Finland’s accession was welcomed by a majority of member states, Sweden’s path to joining NATO remains blocked. Two countries, Hungary and Turkey, have caused delays in Sweden’s accession. Both countries ratified Finland’s accession but remained rigid in their stance about Sweden. Turkey believes that Sweden has not taken Ankara’s security concerns seriously and has not lived up to the mark of the bargain struck in Madrid last year. Hungary has followed Turkey’s lead in delaying the ratification. Unlike Kashmir, the issue of terrorism has had a profound impact on their bilateral relationship. India has since long accused Pakistan of supporting terrorist groups that operate on its soil and carry out attacks on its territory. Similarly, Pakistan has accused India of fueling terrorism on its territory. The most prominent example was the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which unknown gunmen carried out a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai, killing more or less 166 people. Surprisingly, the Indian government blamed Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) for supporting the attack, while Pakistan denied it. Case in point, the one outcome Pakistanis have learned from the recent SCO summit is that India is a terror-sponsoring country with horrific activities in its mind and no sign of respect for foreign leaders, and they are hard to negotiate with; in the same vein, Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan also expressed his displeasure over the way Indian Foreign Minister treated Pakistani Foreign Minister at the SCO summit, Khan accused Jaishankar of being a bad host and lacking etiquette and culture. Meanwhile, Indians, on the other hand, appreciated Jaishankar’s words as an act of revenge. It is evident that India has used the issue of terrorism for political gain, often at the expense of bilateral relations. This has led to counterterrorism efforts becoming entangled with broader political and strategic interests, making it more difficult to develop a comprehensive approach to the issues. Cross fire between Indian and Pakistan forces was a recurrent phenomenon. It usually hurt the unarmed civilians rather than the troops. Realising futility of intermittent exchange of fire across the border, India and Pakistan, always at daggers drawn, agreed to ceasefire that is still being upheld. However, an agreement on no-firearms use between the two countries, akin to Sino-Indian agreement, is nowhere in the offing. Despite the accord, India and China still engaged in fisticuffs at Galwan. However, it is imperative to note that the SCO is a stage that is foundationally against the “Three Evils,” namely, extremism, separatism, and terrorism; the member states can use this forum to set together and discuss the issue and create a common ground to these evils. Nonetheless, the forum does not allow member states to blame or accuse each other directly for supporting these evils. Despite this, the Indian foreign minister Jaishankar deliberately beleaguered Bilawal and accused Pakistan of harboring terrorist organizations inside the country. He further describes Pakistan’s position on Kashmir as effectually backing radicalism: “Victims of terrorism do not sit together with perpetrators of terrorism to discuss terrorism, he said” He even blames Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, a “promoter” and spokesperson for terrorism, and it was a ruthless dismissal at the end of the most prestigious visit between two countries in over a decade. The Turkish leadership believes that Sweden has criticized Turkey for human rights abuses and over democratic standards. They have also charged Sweden with harbouring members of terrorist groups, a charge that Sweden denies. One incident that stopped the Turkish president from accepting Sweden’s accession was the burning of the Muslim holy book Quran outside the Turkish embassy by a solitary anti-Islam activist. After this incident, the Turkish president said, “Sweden can’t join NATO if Quran Burning is allowed.” However, if there are no outcomes with a sign of trust in each other among the member states, then what was the point of attending the summit? Or it means that India and Pakistan have their reason to be part of the bloc? It is worth noting that India is also a sole member of QUAD, and one of the main objectives of the QUAD is to counterbalance China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Meanwhile, India also sees China as a strategic rival and a security threat, especially after the border clashes in 2020. Nevertheless, India’s participation in the Quad has been seen as a way to counterbalance China, while its participation in the SCO has been perceived as a strategy to isolate Pakistan and portray it as a state sponsor of terrorism in the international arena. Nevertheless, it conveys that India’s participation in both organizations reflects a dual-game self-centered strategy. In the interim, working together to address terrorism and promote regional stability, the SCO members must trust each other and should not confront each other. The two ministers did not meet bilaterally, and there was no sign of reconciliation in their last-longer strained relations. Modi is still fettered to his teen-age memory of being a waiter at a tea-stall. The Modi government should turn a new leaf in India’s relations with its neighbours by shunning the strong-man image. He could do better by attending to the economic welfare of the masses and promoting social harmony. NEW DELHI: India has no clarity about its military and strategic objectives vis-à-vis its stated adversaries, Pakistan and China, and can defeat neither of them in a war, a new book by N.C. Asthana, former Indian police officer respected for his insights into security affairs, says. “As the fanfare over the arrival of the first Rafales showed, each of these purchases is hailed and sold to the public by the media as weapons that will flatten India’s enemies. But of course, this is far from the truth,” Varadarajan quotes the book as saying. Asthana believes that exploiting enmity with Pakistan for electoral benefits has made Indian leaders victims of their own rhetoric, where they are left with a one-dimensional policy — one which is unrealistic in view of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. Quoting Napoleon, he notes: “If they want peace, nations should avoid the pinpricks that precede cannon shots.” The Wire on Tuesday carried a review of the book National Security and Conventional Arms Race: Spectre of a Nuclear War. It quotes the book as seeing “a huge mismatch between the militaristic official and media rhetoric, on the one hand, and the reality, which is that India cannot defeat either country militarily”. Asthana argues that the frenzied import of conventional weapons will never guarantee a permanent solution to the military problem posed by Pakistan or China because both the countries are nuclear-weapon states and cannot be decisively defeated on the battlefield. “Under the delusion that India has somehow, magically become invincible, he notes how a large number of Indians seem to be itching for a war.” “In any case, the moment Pakistan feels that it is going to lose a conventional war under the weight of a bigger Indian military, it will feel compelled to go nuclear immediately. This is not 1971. Recall what General Khalid Kidwai, head of Pakistan’s strategic command, told a visiting Italian arms control organisation delegation about the country’s red lines in 2002.” Author says that exploiting enmity with Pakistan for electoral benefits has made Indian leaders victims of their own rhetoric The Wire review recalls General Kidwai as saying that Pakistani nuclear weapons will be used “if the very existence of Pakistan as a state is at stake”. Asthana summarises Gen Kidwai’s red lines thus: “Nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India. In case that deterrence fails, they will be used if India attacks Pakistan and conquers a large part of its territory (space threshold), India destroys a large part either of its land or air forces (military threshold), India proceeds to the economic strangling of Pakistan (economic strangling), India pushes Pakistan into political destabilisation or creates a large-scale internal subversion in Pakistan (domestic destabilisation).” The reviewer, Siddharth Varadarajan, editor of the esteemed current affairs portal, quotes Asthana as suggesting that instead of pouring vast sums of money into expensive weapons imports, India would be better served by finding solutions to the security challenges both Pakistan and China present by strengthening itself internally and pursuing non-military solutions, including diplomacy. Meanwhile, after each new disruption caused by PLA action that violates the status quo, dumbfounded — or perhaps, simply dumb — Indian diplomats housed in that perfectly hideously designed building housing the Indian embassy in Beijing — an architectural horror reflecting Indian ‘PWD chic’ aesthetic also evidenced in the new MEA building on the Rajpath, issue mealymouthed protests, even as the Indian government on its part tries as hard as possible to ignore such provocation. And a horde of  panda-hugging retired diplomats rationalize for an ignorant media each new Chinese provocation as not something to get worked up over, and even less to treat as casus belli (cause for war). Russia has rebuilt its conventional military industry from the ashes, uses its Cyber warfare and energy resources as a weapon against the West so as to be taken seriously. Its is only India which is playing to the gallery. Simply buying expensive off the shelf expensive toys won’t make much of a difference since there is no political will or the economic might to sustain a war, should the need arise. Contrast Misri’s and the Indian government’s defeatist approach laced with awe of China to the “wolf warrior” attitude of Chinese diplomats. A junior official in the Chinese embassy in Delhi publicly upbraided Indian Members of Parliament as if they were a bunch of errant school boys for attending a function hosted by the Tibetan Government-in-exile. Or see how the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman reacted to the brouhaha in India over the Pangong bridge and the MEA’s reminder that this construction was “in areas that have been under the illegal occupation by China for around 60 years [which] India has never accepted”. China’s response: An airy dismissal. Asserting that he was “not aware of” any untoward situation in that area, the Chinese spokesperson informed the international media that such infrastructure build-up “falls within [China’s] sovereignty.” Notice that far from hinting that such construction was unacceptable and that India will counter with military measures, whatever the cost, the MEA, accepted the bridge as a fact of life India can do little about. If by such means the Indian government is reconciling frequently to the changing Chinese delineation of the Sino-Indian border, why doesn’t the Narendra Modi regime stop the charade, go the whole hog, recognize the Chinese claimline in toto, and hand over all the Indian territory China contests because that’s what’s going to happen over time any way if Delhi does not mean to use force to defend and protect Indian territory,or take back the areas the PLA has stealithily occupied? Is it not corroding the boldness of military’s junior leadership that’s gonna be in top ranks at some point of time coz they r shooed whenever they try to be offensive in crisis against the enemy mil (which is brazen n hardheaded). Is this how to prepare for superpower ?!? 1. I am fan of nobody. I judge people and leaders in the political arena by what they do, i.e. their achievements – not what they are, how they look, how much money they earn, or what they say.Another feather in her cap:In 1974 India undertook her first nuclear test (Pokhran) under Indira Gandhi’s direction in a hostile international political climate. Sir,The Nagaland ambush was a case of mistaken identity, in which innocent lives were lost. True, it was a mistake. But it happened as there was credible intelligence of the presence and movement of armed NSCN Cadres in that area, and their intent was not benign. They had to be stopped and eliminated. You are wrong in running down the Indian Army on this score, as that part of the Country is remaining with India only due to the presence of the Armed Forces of the Union Govt. And the Army does not consider the people there as it’s Enemy, and have humbly sought their pardon, unlike the Armies of other Countries. Bharat Karnad’s observations are correct but unfortunately he like most is not aware why such a situation has arisen. Major share of the blame goes to Nehru who had weakened the Army to such an extent that when India requested the US for equipment the US wondered what the Indian Army had and that to when tension was building up since 1959. Nehru hated the Army and he and Menon did not listen to the Army’s advice but had his favourite bureaucrats and intelligence officers as advisors. Nehru was so far from reality that he ordered the Army to throw out the Chinese and went of to Srilanka on a visit. The 62 war was lost before it began. The troops at many places gave a very good account of themselves.Today too before the Chinese build up the Modi Govt to had reduced the Defence budget to 62 levels as a percentage of GDP. Obviously the powers to be despite the past experience had not learnt any lesson. Karnad as a ‘Defence Affairs Strategist’ should know military has no or little role in deciding the policy or role or freedom to take action on the borders without Govt orders and clearance. Hope he knows about the Sumdorong incident where the local Div and Corps commander acted contrary to the orders of the Govt.To deal with China credibily India needs to earnestly prepare and equip itself adequately otherwise. The write up by the author lacks proper understanding of strategy. However he is right when he says  the Govt’s response needs to be strong. To be piloted by USAF. Repeat……and again. There never was a need for Indian pilots or ground staff.Why is it so difficult to accept that the so called nationalists in India are bigger failures of character than Nehru and bear none of the redeeming qualities. So ultimately crypto-westerners in India got U-2 flights as aid. Pray, what to do with a U-2 base.Nehru needed to know that after the Gilpatric Committee report if India figured anywhere in all this or if PMS Blackett and JK Galbraith were just abusing the uncalled for trust reposed on them. And what better way than to, ‘ask for material help and be denied’. But at least in this high stakes game, Nehru preferred to die a lonely man than to push the country into Nuke nude status.Compare that to what did the nationalists did when Trump threatened ‘retaliation’ for a decision he clearly mentioned ‘I don’t like that decision’ from somebody he thought was ‘for many years have been taking advantage of United States’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fka2_vCS8o4. I don’t know which advantage he was talking about – David Headley advantage, Rabinder Singh advantage or the U-2 advantage. I mean if a management control agreement for an HCQ manufacturer is so onerous than how the hell will any of the now to be privatized local military industry ever produce for Indian needs. It is destined for producing the stuff that the ‘FDI investor’ does not needs to produce in its own country. Basically something as irrelevant as U-2. That’s the sort of national self-respect and self-confidence Indians can only dream about Indian leaders, ministers, army generals and MEA officials sporting. Would Modi ever, in any circumstances, instruct the Indian ambassador to do a similar plainspeak in Beijing? Or, order the newly installed Commander, XIV Corps (Leh), Lt. Gen. Anindya Sengupta, in the manifestly useless and futile talks scheduled for January 12, to be abrasive, initiate the meeting by not shaking hands with his Chinese opposite number and, by way of signaling seriousness, walking out of the meeting after telling the PLA general that there’s only one-point on the agenda to discuss — the mechanics of the PLA’s vacating its aggression, pronto, and then staying the hell out.  And demand that Army HQrs issue standing orders to the forward deployed Indian units to make the LAC live with artillery duels and ceaseless tactical action to wrest back lost territory any which way they can, and at any cost? This won’t happen, of course. A Ngāi Te Rangi marae is calling on Māori land blocks to boycott fertilizer from Ballance Agri Nutrients until the firm moves its Mount Maunganui plant. Police have indicated that they won’t support the checkpoints this time. Although they have the authority to establish checkpoints on any road at any time to check for alcohol, for licences, for firearms, for warrants of fitness and even for vehicle registration, they’re telling us they won’t support checkpoints designed to educate and inform people about the deadliest virus to hit NZ’s shores since the Spanish Flu of 1918. And government’s decision to deny the truth, blame the comms team, and then not put forward a plan to deal with this new strain, shows their primary interest is covering their, rather than protecting the wellbeing of their citizens.

Amusingly, soon after Mamata made this bizarre accusation on the central government, she herself was caught in her own web of lies. In January 2019 she announced that she had decided to pull out from Centre’s ‘Ayushman Bharat’ scheme, accusing PM Modi of taking full credit for the scheme and ignoring State’s contribution. ANI had reported Mamata Banerjee as then saying: “My state will not contribute 40% of the funds for the Ayushman scheme. Centre has to pay the full amount if Centre wants to run the scheme”. For example, the Mamata Government dropped “Pradhan Mantri” from the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana scheme. She rechristened the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna scheme to Banglar Awas Yojna. Moreover, she renamed Swacha Bharat Abhiyan to Nirmal Bangla, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Antyodaya Yojana as Anandadhara, Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana as Bangla Griha Prakalpa and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana as Sabar Ghare Alo which translates to lights in everyone’s home. To save, herself from the embarrassment, Mamata lied that the rally was actually organised at the insistence of the anti-corruption crusader. “It was not our rally. It was organised at the insistence of Annaji. It was not a Trinamool Congress rally,” the West Bengal Chief Minister told a news channel. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has time and again accused the Centre of using central agencies to bulldoze the country’s federal structure and sought to know where is the money of Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) fund. Every time the West Bengal Chief Minister has gone on her mindless rant against the central government she has outdone her self. While addressing a rally in the state, Mamata had claimed that if a person does not cast his or her vote, Modi will strike off their name from the voter’s list and claim that they are not Indian citizens, she said. The road that leads up to 2nd May 2021, when the results of the 2021 West Bengal Assembly elections would be declared has been littered with TMC chief, Mamata Banerjee’s, lies. Now, it would be interesting to watch whether these lies peddled by Mamata Banerjee would actually help her achieve her goals or BJP would create history by putting an end to her years of undefeated reign. Only time can tell. While speaking to a news channel, TMC MP Kakoli Ghose Dhastidar had cast aspersions on the character of the victim calling her a ‘sex worker’. She had also ruled out the rape angle. ""While the BJP is all set to take up the issues of TMC's corruption, syndicate raj, bhatija-raj (targeting Abhishek Banerjee), Muslim appeasement and Mamata's opposition to NRC-CAA, Mamata Banerjee is depending on her fighter image and on rousing the Bengali sentiment,"" the book, published by Bloomsbury India, says. In Moynaguri, those who resigned, protesting that loyalists had been ignored, included BJP district secretary Amal Roy. Only this time, it is entirely possible that Mamata is not viewed as the revolutionary being silence, but someone who is perceived to be tyrant silencing the revolutionaries. The eyewitness statements and the obvious discrepancy in Mamata Banerjee’s version of events did not deter the usual suspects from wondering ‘what would the voters think about this’, since it was unfathomable to them that BJP would not believe the events as claimed by Mamata Banerjee. Both the CM and her party workers alleged that it was a conspiracy to keep her out of election campaigns. Although they didn’t name anyone, they tried to blame the BJP for the incident. Eyewitnesses, however, completely trashed Mamata’s claims of being ‘pushed’ by some people. They claimed that the entire account given by Mamata Banerjee was false and that it was an accident. They also said that she was surrounded by police protection at that moment, denying the claim by the CM that there was no police protection around her at the time of the incident. Emerging from the meeting, Mr. Shah flanked by Chief Ministers Eknath Shinde of Maharashtra and Basavaraj Bommai of Karnataka said fake Twitter handles created in the name of senior politicians played a role in whipping up emotions.

A viral screenshot of an alleged tweet shared by the Bhartiya Janata Party is being shared to claim that the party has formed alliance with AIMIM for the upcoming West Bengal elections. However, we found that the screenshot is fake and BJP had not made any such announcement till the time of publishing the article. Further, we found that the viral screenshot is fake due to various reasons. Firstly, the Twitter handle mentioned in the screenshot is @bjp4india. But the official Twitter handle of BJP is @BJP4India, that is, it has letters in uppercase. Looking at the engagement statistics mentioned in the screenshot, it raises suspicion that a tweet about an important political development received no quote tweet. The alleged tweet mentioned in the screenshot reads: “We have formed alliance with AIMIM in upcoming WB elections.

Thus, a tweet by satirical news website was shared on social media and believed to be true by many. Earlier, an image of rape accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal was also shared with a satirical quote attributed by Unpaid Times. This was shared by Madhu Kishwar. In the backdrop of GHMC polls, an image of AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi is viral with the following quote attributed to him, “I will convert to Hinduism and name myself Bhagya raj Tripathi if BJP wins GHMC elections.” Alt News looked up the quote on Google and found that none of the mainstream media outlets has reported that Owaisi made the statement in question. Had Owaisi said that he will convert to Hinduism if the BJP wins GHMC elections, it would have certainly been covered by the media. We noticed that the tweet by @UnPaidTimes from December 4 at 11:22 am gained most retweets. In fact, using EPOC time we found that it was first to make this claim. As per Unpaid Times’ bio and website, it is a satirical website. Recently, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won the Bihar election and Mahagathbandhan lost. After the loss, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress alleged All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) nominated its candidates on seats with good no. of Muslim votes to divert the votes of RJD and Congress and thus letting BJP win. In the backdrop of this, a screenshot purportedly of BJP's Tweet is being shared on social media claiming that the party is forming an alliance with AIMIM in West Bengal Assembly Elections 2021. @BJP4India also had 'quote tweet' in all its tweet which was not available in a viral tweet despite an important political development.

The screenshot says, ""We have formed an alliance with AIMIM in upcoming WB elections."" We then compared the viral tweet with a tweet from the original Twitter handle of BJP. We found that the original Twitter handle of BJP is '@BJP4India' while the one that has gone viral has '@bjp4india'. Another thing to notice is that retweets and likes shown on the viral screenshot are very high compared to retweets and likes on other tweets of BJP. Therefore, an old image featuring TMC Chief Mamata Banerjee and Home Minister Amit Shah was falsely linked with the upcoming state assembly elections in West Bengal. Recently, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s old video from 2016 was shared to target AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi. In the video, Arvind Kejriwal was seen reading a letter by then BJP leader Yatin Oza where it was alleged that Owaisi had struck a secret deal with the BJP. After the revival of this old and unrelated video, Owaisi is being called a ‘BJP agent’. Furthermore, Congress held AIMIM responsible for polarization during the recently concluded Bihar elections. Sharing this image on Twitter, some users similarly attempted to portray that BJP’s arch-rival in West Bengal Mamata Banerjee was seen together with Amit Shah and Nitish Kumar discussing the upcoming state assembly elections. The report also included a tweet by the official handle of Odisha CM posted on February 28. After the UP assembly elections results, a post went viral on social media claiming that candidates from Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) have “ensured” BJP’s win by dividing the votes. It claims that AIMIM contested “165 seats” where the BJP won with a low margin and these votes would have ensured BJP’s defeat if they had instead gone to the SP-RLD camp. We checked the Election Commission of India (ECI) website to see the number of AIMIM candidates who contested the UP elections. We found that the party contested 96 seats out of the 403 seats in the state. This itself debunks the claim that in 165 seats AIMIM candidates “assisted” BJP to win. To sum it up, the viral figure shared by many opposition leaders and supporters is wrong. AIMIM has contested in less than 100 seats. Moreover, the winning margin shown in the viral post is also incorrect. Kalim is a journalist with a keen interest in tech, misinformation, culture, etc As a response to it,  Malviya posted a ""propaganda vs reality"" tweet with a video of the same image shared by Rahul Gandhi  and another image that showed he cop raising the baton but the farmer escaping the blow. He wrote, ""Rahul Gandhi must be the most discredited opposition leader India has seen in a long long time."" BJP Forged Alliance With AIMIM For West Bengal Assembly Elections 2021?

New Delhi, December 2:  Social media platform, Twitter has marked a post by BJP IT Cell Head, Amit Malviya  as 'manipulated media'. Malviya on November 28,  tweeted a 'fact-check' post to counter  a picture shared by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wherein an elderly Sikh farmer was seen being hit by the police during the on-going farmers' protest in Delhi. Indian Army's BrahMos Missile Failed While Testing?

The post was published on December 18, 2019, by a page named 'Rail News Center.' An old video of an overloaded goods train carrying petroleum coke colliding with the shed of a railway station in Chhattisgarh is viral with false claims that the goods train belongs to the Adani group and that the footage shows coal pollution during transportation in Goa. BOOM found that the incident happened at Raigarh station in Chhattisgarh in 2019. The goods train was heading to Katni in Madhya Pradesh from Paradeep port in Chhattisgarh. BOOM contacted superintendent of police Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, Santosh Singh. ""The accident is nearly an year old and from Raigarh. As far as I remember the train belonged to South Eastern Coal Limited and not Adani as Adani's transportation is being done by road and not train."" We then searched with 'train collision Raigad' keywords and found an article published by a Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar on December 19, 2019. According to the report, the goods train was heading towards Katni in Madhya Pradesh from Paradeep port in Chhattisgarh carrying petroleum coke. The article includes the same viral video. On asking whether the group transport coals in Raigarh region in Chattisgarh by train, the spokesperson said, ""no we do not transport it by train."" We analysed the video and found that at the time stamp of 41 second, the station name is clearly visible, i.e. Raigarh, which is not a station in the state of Goa. Although Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh both have a place named Raigarh, the board has 'द.पू.म.रेलवे' (dakshin purv madhya railway) or South East Central Railway written on it. This narrows down to the Raigarh situated in Chhattisgarh. ""You must have never seen this yogi form of Modi Ji,"" a Twitter handle @Gajjusay tweeted, sharing the black and white video clip. Another Twitter account which goes by the name ""Akash RSS"" also shared the video claiming it shows Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

It can be concluded that an old video of yoga guru BKS Iyengar is shared on social media with the false claim that it shows PM Narendra Modi. New Delhi, November 26: An old video clip purportedly showing young Narendra Modi doing yoga poses is going viral on social media platforms. A lot of people are actually believing that the black and white video is of Narendra Modi doing yoga asanas. The short clip is widely circulated on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter by supporters of Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP Forged Alliance With AIMIM For West Bengal Assembly Elections 2021? Screenshot of Fake Tweet Goes Viral, Here's The Truth. This is a false claim. The video is of yoga guru BKS Iyengar. Amit Shah’s photo has been cropped from an image of the Home Minister with Captain Amarinder Singh, the Chief Minister of Punjab. There have been no discussions between the BJP and Owaisi about entering into an alliance ahead of assembly elections in several states. The image has been morphed. Earlier during the Hyderabad municipal elections in December 2020, a four-year-old photograph of Union Minister Smriti Irani with Owaisi was shared to spread a false rumour about the two teaming up for the polls. Alt News performed a reverse image search using Yandex and found the original photo in an article by The News Minute. However, a different man is seen here with Owaisi. This story is dated February 28, 2018. It discusses Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and his brother, MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi, requesting the state government to relocate displaced street vendors. The two leaders met the Commissioner of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) B Janardhana Reddy and the Chief Secretary of Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD) Arvind Kumar to discuss the matter. He wrote a letter to the state government stating that construction work for the Charminar Pedestrianization Project (CPP) would leave several hawkers unemployed, and three bridges should be built on the River Musi to allow them to sell their products there. The Quint’s WebQoof team had earlier debunked the false claim that the BJP had formed an alliance with AIMIM for the upcoming West Bengal elections. The social media posts showed the image of Owaisi with Irani and mentioned: “Owaisi met Smriti Irani. Owaisi asks people to vote for BJP in LokSabha elections. And some fools think Owaisi is a saviour of Muslims. (sic)” (Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?

The Indian Navy has made it clear that it will not allow Yuan Wang-6 to enter the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which extends 200 nautical miles into the sea. In 2019, Indian Navy warships had chased away a suspected Chinese spy vessel, Shi Yan 1, purportedly doing research activity close to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Commodore Anil Jai Singh (retd), a submariner, says the suspect Chinese vessels in the IOR are technically not warships and fall in the surveyor ship category. India, he says, cannot really do much unless the ships do something overtly hostile. “If the vessels stay in the high seas, that’s everybody’s territory. But we need to monitor their activity. Since these are not warships, technically they have the right to venture into EEZs too,” Commodore Singh said. The movement of Yuan Wang-6 came barely 20 days after India conducted the test firing of a Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) from INS Arihant, its first indigenous nuclear submarine. The projectile hit the target area in the Bay of Bengal with high accuracy. Indian military planners say China has a long-term strategy to operate in the IOR. It has set up a submarine base in Bangladesh in return for two submarines given to Dhaka. China has also provided an old submarine to Myanmar while eight submarines are being given to Pakistan. The ministry of defence (MoD) said in a statement that the SLBM launch was ”significant to prove crew competency and validate” ballistic missiles which are a “key element of India’s nuclear deterrence capability”. The launch made India only the sixth country with capability to conduct nuclear strikes and counterstrikes on land, sea and air. The other countries are US, Russia, UK, France and China. In August, the Chinese spy ship Yuan Wang-5 had docked at Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port despite concerns raised by New Delhi. Yuan Wang-5 is a dual-use ship with capability to track satellites, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has 400 crew members and advanced equipment. PLA Navy presence in the IOR has been a growing concern for India. Some time back, the Indian Navy’s maritime long-range surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft P-8I had detected as many as seven Chinese Navy warships around the Indian Ocean. On November 2, India successfully conducted the test flight of the Phase-II ballistic missile defence (BMD) interceptor AD-1 missile from the A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast. Next in line was the November 10-11 trial of the Agni series nuclear-capable ballistic missile. Indian military planners are working out fresh dates for user trials of the Agni series nuclear-capable ballistic missile, scheduled for November 10-11. This comes amidst the Indian Navy keeping a close watch on the movement of Chinese spy ship Yuan Wang-6 in the Indian Ocean region (IOR).

Indian government is still influenced by British colonialism.  They tend to compare us vs them in each and every thing..Regarding Nepal,  Indian ambassador went to meet prime Minister wearing sandals ( chappal)  and during talk he put his one leg above another . And was dictating what and what not to do during writing new constitution.Even a puny ambassador showed arrogance and lacked mannerisms.  Because according to india mindset , nepal is landlocked and have to ask help from India for trades and all..There is no friendship between nepal , its all blackmailing and bullying. You reduced bad people to an entire religion! This shows your adharma. Much better if you question Modi’s foreign policy. But why BD, Nepal and Afghanistan. What not has been said by BJP Supporters about Bangladesh despite them being nice to us. We took their diplomacy to b their weakness. Same with Nepal, we blocked their supplies during the earthquake because they went the Democratic way. And Afghanistan, what’s with them – the hatred BJP and it’s voters have for Muslims then why the need for Afghanistan and Taliban Deal to go through.The Indian Foreign Policy has been a disaster. It has been driven by fake slogans and rhetoric. India really needs to get to stop looking at its neighbour from a religious lens. The whole Assam Campaign was based on hate towards Bangaldeshi Muslims. And we think they didn’t see that? How dumb are we? These small countries – Pak, Bdesh, Nepal, Srilanka – have no identity of their own, except that the former two are famous for radical islam and terrorists.  Basically, all these populations are originally hindus, now turned into followers of alien faith and values and hence struggling for own identity. There lies the problem and here comes the deveil – the atheist chinaman – peddling these unfortunate people towards new land of opportunity; yes, allegiance to CCP.  China will usurp all these lands, except India, and this may come at enormous cost of their bleeding resources and population.  Ke sera sera. It is very well true that Modi ji has alienated India  from socialistic economic system and countries who have leaning to leftist ideology . Modi ji has now completely aligned India  to America and countries in American Group. He appears to be ready taking direct confrontation with China with the help of Israel,Japan and Australia. Modi ji`s  Hindutv  is limited only to election propaganda and capturing the seat of prime minister and it has no role at all in foreign policy .Amit Shah and his coitrie is number one fool who is spoiling the whole game of Modi. This  contradiction in ministry  is making India  weak. One key reason for the missing warmth is the Home minister Amit Shah’s charge in 2018 that illegal immigrants in Assam are like “deemak” or termites who take away the jobs of locals; Shah repeated the charge in West Bengal during the 2019 campaign, adding that if the BJP came to power, it would throw all infiltrators into the Bay of Bengal. The BJP has de-accelerated the economy.  The priority for Hindus is to beat up Muslims in India. CAA-NRC doesn’t come into the picture even a bit. Bangladesh even said that they would take back all illegal immigrants into India if India can provide proof. You and the author needs to understand that the world doesn’t revolve around what Amit Shah says. You rightly pointed out the remarks made by BJP leaders especially Amit Shah clearly shows that they consider Bangladesh as nobody. They should have been careful about their remarks and political moves. Bangladesh under Hasina will never think of forgetting the contributions of India during our liberation war and subsequently solving our long-standing border disputes.. On its part, Bangladesh, under Hasina has been behaving as a friend of India, particularly in stopping the terrorist training camps of North East insurgents of India, providing transit facilities to India. We expect BJP leaders should check their tongues and stop behaving like Big brother.  We want a relationship with mutual respect and friendship.

October 18: India successfully test-fired BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from Navy’s indigenously-built stealth destroyer INS Chennai. The 'prime strike weapon' will ensure the warship's invincibility by engaging naval surface targets at long ranges, thus making the destroyer another lethal platform of Indian Navy. October 5: India tested Supersonic Missile Assisted Release of Torpedo (SMART), a system that can hit enemy submarines when they are beyond torpedo range. Called as ""game changer"" in anti-submarine warfare, is yet another milestone in strengthening the country''s maritime strategic capabilities. New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: In a major shot in the arm to India's missile strike capabilities, India on Monday successfully testfired Stand-off Anti-tank (SANT) Missile off the coast of Odisha. The missile developed by DRDO, will soon be inducted in the Indian Air Force. According to news agency ANI, the missile will have both Lock-on After Launch and Lock-on Before Launch capability. With tensions flaring up with china in the aftermath of Galwan valley clash along Line of Actual Control in East Ladakh, India's missile system have taken huge leaps over a period of two months. Notably, we have the fourth largest air force in the world. The Armed Forces have also deployed a sizeable number of BrahMos supersonic missiles at the LAC. Indo-China border standoff: Here is a list of missiles India testfired over a period of one and a half month amid growing tension with China. October 1: The indigenously developed laser-guided anti-tank guided missile was successfully test fired by the DRDO at a firing range in Maharashtra''s Ahmednagar. The laser-guided anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) is likely to significantly enhance the fire-power capability of the Indian Army particularly along the frontiers with Pakistan and China. The missile employs a tandem heat warhead to defeat explosive reactive armour protected armoured vehicles. It has been developed with multiple-platform launch capability and is currently undergoing technical evaluation trials from gun of MBT Arjun. September 23: India tested indigenously developed laser-guided anti-tank guided missile in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar. With the help of laser designation to ensure precision hit accuracy, they lock and track the targets. The missile employs a tandem HEAT warhead to defeat Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) protected armoured vehicles. September 22: India successfully conducted the flight test of ABHYAS - High-speed Expendable Aerial Target (HEAT) - from a test range in Odisha. Developed by the Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) of the DRDO, the air vehicle is launched using twin underslung boosters. It is powered by a small gas turbine engine and has an Inertial Navigation System (INS) along with a Flight Control Computer. Benjamin Mainardi is a postgraduate student in the Department of War Studies at King's College London. His research has largely focused on naval affairs and Indo-Pacific security. Here we clearly see that talk of China’s massive navy is rather out of proportion. It should be noted that China’s fleet relies disproportionately on smaller classes of ships, like the frigate and corvette, which are widely considered not to be major surface combatants. Even still, the bulk of its numbers advantage comes from its coastal patrol ships which, while not insignificant, have limited capacity to project power beyond China’s near seas. Further, the United States maintains a massive carrier advantage. Wherever one falls on the debate over the continued viability of aircraft carriers, the fact remains that both states are interested in producing them."

This time, the BJP has tied up with the newly formed UPPL (United People’s Party Liberal), which will contest eight of the 12 seats in BTAD areas while the saffron party will contest the remaining four. The BPF, as part of the Congress-led alliance, will contest all 12 BTAD seats. In 2016, the Bodo votes in the region, which has a significant Muslim population, remained consolidated under the BPF while the non-Bodo votes were split between the Congress and the AIUDF, a party that represents the interests of the Muslims of immigrant origin in Assam. However, all these electoral projections may remain mere possibilities. For instance, though the Congress-AIUDF combine has the potential to secure wins in at least 46 seats, the list of candidates declared so far does not indicate a coherent strategy for it. The Congress will contest 93 seats while the AIUDF has been allotted 14 seats. However, the Badruddin Ajmal-led party has fielded candidates in five more seats in a ‘friendly contest’ against the Congress. This when the Congress curren­tly occupies four of these five seats. Congress insiders say the AIUDF is working with the BJP, taking directions from state finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. They claim the public spat between Sarma and AIUDF chief Ajmal is to consolidate their respective vote banks, and that they are working tog­ether behind the scenes. “This ‘friendly contest’ is suicide,” says a senior Congress leader. “That’s why we had opposed an alliance. The AIUDF is working with the BJP to [prevent] the consolidation of the anti-BJP votes in lower Assam and the Barak Valley.” It is noteworthy that promises to build the bridge were made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and current Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. Yet despite the foundation stone having been laid almost five years ago, construction is yet to take place. Majuli is the world’s largest inhabited river island, spread over 553 square kilometers. It is home to over 1,67,000 people, from many indigenous communities including Missings, Deoris, Sonowal Kacharis as well as many Scheduled Castes as well. It is connected to Jorhat via a ferry service that ordinarily operates six times a day. This ferry service is the island’s lifeline, but its upgrade and modernisation have been long overdue. Due to its size and population, Majuli was named a district in June 2016. Consider the state of health services in Assam. Sarma has been health minister since 2006 except for a brief period between 2014 and 2016 when he quit the Congress to join the BJP. In the month and a half since he became the chief minister, most of Sarma’s public utterances have been a continuation of his pre-election avatar, rife with communally-loaded innuendo. After a few days of behind-the-scenes wrangling, the incumbent chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal made way for Sarma, who was sworn in on May 9. This was a testament to Sarma’s meteoric rise in the saffron party which he had joined only in 2015, months before the last assembly elections, after spending over 20 years in the Congress. In six years, Sarma had made himself indispensable to the BJP with his ability to stitch up alliances and firefight in times of crisis not just in Assam but across the North East as the leader of the North East Democratic Alliance, a broad coalition of non-Congress parties in the region.

A meeting called by former J&K Chief Minister and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah at his residence on Wednesday could not be held due to strict restrictions put in place by the Union Territory’s administration, his son and former CM Omar Abdullah said on Twitter. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, medical emergencies and movement of staff with valid cards and passes issued by the administration have been exempted from the restrictions. The coalition said that the Centre did not take any substantial confidence-building measures such as releasing political prisoners from jails and ending the “atmosphere of suppression that has choked J&K since 2019”. The Congress leader claimed that the Opposition was not allowed to talk about Jammu and Kashmir, the Pegasus surveillance controversy and the Rafale deal in Parliament. Hindenburg Allegations Against Adani Group - The six-member expert panel set up by the Supreme Court said it would not be possible to conclude that there was a regulatory failure on Securities and Exchange Board of India’s part in its handling of certain allegations of violations against Adani Group companies. While the country celebrated, debated and outraged, Kashmir — under a communication blockade that has still not been lifted completely and inundated with security personnel — was largely silent. We look at the key moments of the past year: Rather, it was the emphasis on delimitation in J&K by the Prime Minister and Home Minister at the meeting with J&K political leaders that certainly suggested a focus narrower than the shifting sands of regional geopolitics, which demand grand gestures of reconciliation, people-friendly confidence-building measures, and big promises. There were none of those in the meeting, and there is no indication that such gestures are in the pipeline. There was no timeline to the assurance on the restoration of statehood, a reiteration of a commitment made by the Home Minister in Parliament. When the Prime Minister invited the mainstream regional parties for talks, what stood out was the walk-back from his earlier stand that the parties were irrelevant to the “Naya Kashmir” that had been inaugurated in August 2019. It was an out-of-character move. Most observers of the Modi-Shah BJP agree that the party does not do U-turns. These tend to be perceived by both supporters and detractors as admissions of failure. From demonetisation in 2016 to the farm laws that triggered the still-ongoing farmers’ agitation, there have been no U-turns by this government."

In November, 2019, an Instagram user claimed an image of Rheum nobile was a “Mahameru flower that blooms once every 400 years in the Himalayas”, adding that those fortunate enough to see the plant in bloom would receive a “lifetime of good luck”. While some plants have been known to live for as long as a century before blooming, a social media post claims one spectacular Himalayan flower takes rarity to a new extreme – blossoming only once in 400 years. A viral photo shows a Himalayan flower that blooms only once in 400 years. Rather, in a 2019 study published in Annals of Botany, Prof Stöcklin and his co-authors estimated the average length of time it took Rheum nobile to reach flowering size was 33.5 years. He also noted bamboos included species that only flowered after long periods of time, pointing to a recent review which indicated some varieties could remain in their vegetative phases for as long as 100 years. Laurence Dorr, a research botanist at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, told AAP FactCheck he could not imagine a plant that blooms every 400 years, adding that few species even lived for that long. The plant, also known as Sikkim rhubarb, is a monocarpic perennial native to the Himalayas that grows to more than a metre tall. Monocarpic perennials spend at least a year in a vegetative state before flowering once and dying. Multiple experts contacted by AAP FactCheck could not name any plants in the Himalayas or elsewhere that lasted for as long as 400 years between flowering. “Yes, many plants have long juvenile periods. However, these last for a decade or so. Monocarpic plants like bamboos take 40 years or so to flower and then die off,” Prof Babbar said in an email. False. The plant, Rheum nobile, blooms once before dying. Researchers say this occurs on average after about 33 years. The caption reads: “This is a rare flower of called Mahameru of Tibet that blooms once every 400 years. It’s auspicious to see it even as a photo.....share please.” “Mahameru flower or Arya flower. Can be found in the Himalayan mountains. It blooms only every 400 years. If we are to see it again we would have to wait for another 400 years,” the Sinhala-language post reads. Similar posts surfaced on Facebook in June 2021, as seen here and here. “This is Salvia 'Hot Lips', a garden variety commonplace in the UK and it flowers every year,” he told AFP. “I am not so sure that 'Mahameru flower' actually exists!” According to its description, the plant known as ‘salvia microphylla’ is a garden variety plant that thrives in sunlight and blooms from July to October. The name ‘hot lips’ comes from the flower’s white and lipstick red colour, it notes. Botanists also said that the flower in the image is salvia ‘hot lips’. ""This is the flower which is known as ""Mahameru Pushpam"" or Arya Pu. It's seen in the Himalayas. It flowers once in 400 years. If we wanted to see it again, you need to wait for another 400 years.

The ""flowers"" of protea cynaroides are actually flower heads surrounded by large colorful bracts. The flower heads vary in size, from about 120 mm to 300 mm in diameter. Large, vigorous plants produce six to ten flower heads in one season, although some exceptional plants can produce up to forty flower heads on one plant. The color of the bracts varies prized. Protea flowers are national flowers of South Africa and are found in large numbers in the country. According to `pza.sanbi.com', a website of South African national biodiversity institute,  Protea cynaroides is a woody shrub with thick stems and large dark green, glossy leaves. Most plants are one meter in height when mature, but may vary according to locality and habitat from 0.35 m to 2 meters in height."

Nelson recently founded the start-up QuantivRisk, which aims to collect driving data from Tesla and other carmakers before analyzing it and selling the results to police departments, insurance companies, law offices and research labs. (Hannah Yoon/The New York Times)Shortly before 2 p.m. on a clear July day in 2020, as Tracy Forth was driving near Tampa, Florida, her white Tesla Model S was hit from behind by another car in the left lane of Interstate 275.It was the kind of accident that occurs thousands of times a day on U.S. highways. When the vehicles collided, Forth’s car slid into the median as the other one, a blue Acura sport utility vehicle, spun across the highway and onto the far shoulder.After the collision, Forth told police officers that Autopilot — a Tesla driver-assistance system that can steer, brake and accelerate cars — had suddenly activated her brakes for no apparent reason. She was unable to regain control, according to the police report, before the Acura crashed into the back of her car. Singh, a long-haul truck driver, said the stretch near the site of the crash along the Okanagan Connector, also known as Highway 97C, is treacherous. Truck driver Kalwinder Singh says he knows the Okanagan Connector well, and regards the British Columbia highway as among the worst roads in North America. “The B.C. government don't clean the roads,” he said. “It's so slippery.

Comparing the number of road fatalities in relation to the number of vehicle kilometers driven (total distance travelled by motor vehicles) provides a better indicator for assessing the risk of travelling on a given road network. The number of traffic deaths in relation to the number of registered vehicles sometimes serves as an approximation for the fatality rate in the absence of data on distance travelled,” the report stated.

I wonder why should the Supreme Court, I think it has many better things to do than to entertain a PIL of this nature. Not that this matter is not pending before the Supreme Court, it is only pending in an appeal or SLP filed by the Gujarat government against the Gujarat High Court judgment. Where is the question of saying which states have implemented or not. It is not in the domain of the judiciary to decide what sort of legislation should be passed by legislature. Why should we start asking them at the instance of a person who is in court every second day? And especially when I don't know if he disclosed that earlier he had withdrawn the petition. He was duty-bound to disclose that. Not only that, Justice Nariman had made some observations...I believe that if you don't find merit in the petition, just dismiss it, don't say 'we give you liberty to move another court'. A lot of the time, this liberty is misused"" Justice Gupta: ""I am not really competent to talk about ground realities. I can only talk about my state Himachal, and at that stage, based on the facts that were before me. I really don't know what is happening. If people are being converted by coercion or fraud or allurement of the nature that I alluded to earlier, that may be violative of the law laid down. It is nothing wrong if the law is made to that extent. But you cannot take it to the extent that the offender would be the person who converts. Here, you are making the person who is converting the criminal. Even when there is fraud or coercion or allurement against him, that person is virtually a victim. Even if I take the other view that he has been fraudulently converted, that person is the victim, why should that person become the criminal and be charged with an offence because he or she has not applied for a permission. I can tell you one thing that I can say with certainty- these Acts are coming for political reasons more than actual reasons. I can't talk of the whole country but in Himachal, I knew at that time that the percentage of conversion was hardly there, it is a very educated state, the literacy rate is one of the highest in the country. It is not that people don't change religions, people change religions, people even change thoughts, you develop when thoughts change, you cannot live in the same old religious thoughts all the time. So there will be some development, religion also changes with time, it is not that it doesn't change with time. But I'm not sure, I cannot say with certainty...because one has read reports, whether there is mass conversion in central India, in the tribal areas, where it is being said that they are almost being forced to convert, that may be there I don't know. Interestingly, the Act in Himachal was brought in by a Congress government supported by the BJP, the only amendment that was made by the opposition was to make it archer, the Congress chief minister readily agreed to. It was passed unanimously, the Act. I only struck down that portion of the Act and the rules which asked a converted to disclose his or her intention to change the religion"" Interestingly no senior functionary of the government, including the Information and Broadcasting Minister or the Union Home Minister, assured the brand that action would be taken against the trolls or deal with the perceived threat to the employees, partners and stores of the jewellery brand. According to Section 3 of the Himachal Pradesh law, “No person shall convert or attempt to convert, either directly or otherwise, any other person from one religion to another by use of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, inducement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage; nor shall any person abet or conspire such conversion.” It also lays down that any marriage done for the sole purpose of religious conversion may be declared null and void by a court on a petition by either party. If the person is reconverted to the parent religion, it will not be considered as conversion. Those found contravening the section will face imprisonment for one year, extendable to five years with a fine. Where violation of Section 3 involved the conversion of minors, women or a person from Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe groups, the punishment ranges from a minimum of two years’ imprisonment extendable up to seven years. Section 5 of the Act deems that marriages conducted for the sole purpose of conversion will be declared null and void. Also read:Conversion debate"

That’s primarily because of how the virus spreads. The virus isn’t chilling out in your mouth, it’s actually in your nose having come in through the air. It’s breathed in. So drinking water won’t help you flush the virus out -- although staying hydrated is always a good idea. FACT: There’s no evidence that this is true, although the World Health Organization does note that there is limited evidence that this can help you recover more quickly from the common cold (not COVID-19). Regular saline rinses have not yet been shown to prevent respiratory infections. FACT: There’s no scientific proof that vitamin C is really that effective for fighting virus infections. “For the most part, the results of studies have been that vitamin C doesn’t work to prevent viral diseases other than for a certain part of the population in very specific situations,” Dr. Joshi said. FACT: Chlorine dioxide is an industrial bleach and is incredibly dangerous to gargle, let alone swallow. It is not made for human bodies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that drinking bleach is not effective or safe for treating any illness. On the contrary it can cause severe reactions like vomiting, diarrhea and acute liver failure. So, in summary: do not put bleach in your mouth. FACT: There is no evidence to support that belief, Dr. Joshi said. The Food and Drug Administration has already issued warning letters to several essential oil companies warning them to stop saying their products can help against COVID-19. FACT: Garlic is good for you, however there isn’t any evidence that it protects people from the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. FACT: While neither will stop you from becoming sick from COVID-19, they are definitely worth getting, especially if you’re elderly according to Dr. Joshi said. But, again, they won’t save you from COVID-19. There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although there are clinical trials in action right now to try and change that. MYTH: Hot air from a sauna or hair dryer will kill COVID-19. It is worth noting that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), touching a surface or object contaminated with the virus and then touching one's own face ""is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads"". In May, the CDC updated its guidance to say that Covid-19 spreads ""very easily"" from person to person through contaminated droplets produced by others as they talk, cough, sneeze and breath. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has now published a list of disinfectants and active ingredients that can be used against the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Ultraviolet light can also be used to disinfect some surfaces, but is not currently recommended for use on human skin. (Read more about whether UV light can kill Covid-19.) On clothing and other surfaces harder to disinfect, it is not yet clear how long the virus can survive. The absorbent natural fibres in cardboard, however, may cause the virus to dry up more quickly than on plastic and metal, suggests Vincent Munster, head of the virus ecology section at Rocky Mountain Laboratories and one of those who led the NIH study. Although there is no data on how many virus particles will be in a single droplet coughed up by an infected person, research on the flu virus suggests smaller droplets can contain many tens of thousands of copies of the influenza virus. However, this can vary depending on the virus itself, where in the respiratory tract it is found and at what stage in the infection the person is. The findings suggest the virus might last this long on door handles, plastic-coated or laminated worktops and other hard surfaces. Another more recent study released in May by microbiologists in Beijing, China, found that Sars-CoV-2 could survive and remain infectious on smooth surfaces including plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics and latex gloves for up to seven days. They found they could not obtain infectious viral particles from cotton clothing after four days and that no virus could be obtained from paper surface after five days. The ability of the virus to linger for so long only underlines the importance of hand hygiene and cleaning of surfaces, according to Munster. The virus that causes Covid-19 is thought to survive for longer on hard surfaces than on materials such as cardboard (Credit: Getty Images) It means that the virus circulating in unfiltered air conditioning systems will only persist for a couple of hours at the most, especially as aerosol droplets tend to settle on surfaces faster in disturbed air. Even so, the CDC, the World Health Organization and others health authorities, have emphasised that both washing one's hands, along with cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily are key in preventing Covid-19's spread. The CDC's latest guidance for how schools, restaurants and other public places can start to reopen details the need for intensified cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces such as playground equipment, door handles, bathroom taps and drinking fountains. It also admits that scientists are still learning about exactly how the virus spreads. So, although we still don't know exactly how many cases are being caused directly by contaminated surfaces, experts advise exercising caution. The WHO has said that dryers cannot kill the new coronavirus and that the virus can still be transmitted in hot and humid climates, the Associated Press (AP) reports. “False! Please don’t. Our nose carries bacteria, as part of normal flora. Those bacteria may get confused.” Instead of recommending the same, Okeechobee County Commissioner Bryant Culpepper cited a suggestion he said he saw on One American News Network, saying that blowing a hair dryer up the nose could “kill” the coronavirus. Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are asked to self-isolate for 14 days in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Health officials were quick to pipe in, saying not only will this method not work, but it will also irritate your skin, eyes, nose and mouth. “Depending on how hot the blow dryer gets, I would be concerned with some adverse effects,” she told AP. To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out. Dr. Jen Caudle, a family physician and associate professor at Rowan University in New Jersey, also confirmed that blowing hot air into a nose will not prevent or cure COVID-19. Similarly, hot water from a faucet will not be hot enough to kill the novel coronavirus. In the United States, water from a faucet cannot reach above 120°F (49°C). However, heat may not be a practical or reliable method of protecting against the SARS-CoV-2 virus for several reasons. In home settings, appliances and hot water faucets usually cannot get hot enough to provide the temperatures required to kill SARS-CoV-2. Even then, it may not be possible to use temperatures high enough to kill SARS-CoV-2 in the home, as many appliances and faucets cannot provide water hot enough to deactivate the virus. The following sources do not provide enough heat to kill SARS-CoV-2: People should not use heat to kill SARS-CoV-2 on or inside the body. The temperatures that kill SARS-CoV-2 are unsafe for humans and animals and will cause burns. However, as these experiments took place in highly controlled laboratories, they do not necessarily reflect how effective heat is at killing the novel coronavirus in more everyday settings, such as hospitals or a person’s home. However, although high temperatures can sterilize objects that may have come into contact with SARS‐CoV‐2, this means killing the virus is not always reliable, achievable, or safe to try at home. It is possible for someone to develop COVID-19 after touching food that contains SARS-CoV-2 and then touching their eyes, mouth, or nose. However, despite the possibility, there are no current cases of COVID-19 that doctors can attribute to contact with contaminated food. In some cases, it is not safe to rely on heat for protection against SARS-CoV-2. This may be because the heat source cannot get hot enough for long enough or because exposure to such high temperatures would be dangerous. Most washing machines do not reach temperatures high enough to kill SARS-CoV-2. Machines that can reach temperatures of 158°F (70°C) or above for 5 minutes may be able to do that, but research has not confirmed this. ""There isn't any strong evidence connecting environmental temperature to the transmission of coronavirus -- it's more about how long you spend in close proximity to an infected person,"" he said. ""Breathing from saunas or a hair dryer would not have any effect on preventing or treating coronavirus, and both are downright weird,"" Neuman told AFP by email, adding that relying on desert air for that purpose is ""equally insane."" A video viewed hundreds of thousands of times claims that breathing in hot air from a hair dryer or in a sauna can prevent or cure COVID-19. This is false; an expert in coronaviruses said these methods would not be effective, while a cell biologist said there is no evidence the virus can be treated via heat. ""So far there is ABSOLUTELY no evidence that the COVID-19 virus can be treated via heat,"" Le Roch told AFP by email. None of the methods suggested in the video appear on the CDC's page on how to protect against the virus, nor this page about caring for yourself if you are sick. Regarding using a hair dryer, ""there is ABSOLUTELY no scientific evidence that it can prevent you from catching COVID-19 or treating the novel coronavirus,"" she added. None of the methods advocated in the video appear on the WHO's page offering advice to the public about the virus. ""No desert or sauna available? No problem. The common, widely available hand-held blow dryer, used for drying hair, contains a heating element and a fan that instantly deliver forced hot air temperatures that will kill coronavirus even faster,"" the speaker says. Dr. Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, said the sauna, desert and hair dryer methods would not be effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says on its novel coronavirus frequently asked questions page: ""It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19."" Aside from laundry, there aren’t many temperature-related ways to safely and effectively kill the new coronavirus in your home. Additionally, some temperature-related methods can actually be harmful. A new study suggests that warm weather and increased humidity will probably not be effective in stopping the spread of COVID-19. You may have heard that warm weather and UV light can kill germs, including viruses. However, soaking up the sun to prevent COVID-19 isn’t a good idea. Generally speaking, using high temperature isn’t the most effective or safest way to kill SARS-CoV-2 that may be present on surfaces. The water from your tap won’t be hot enough to kill the new coronavirus. However, using unheated soapy water will be enough to kill the virus. Experts say that while some studies have shown ultraviolet radiation can kill microorganisms, it is not sanctioned as a COVID-19 therapy and such… These methods are unlikely to produce the temperatures needed to effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2. If you have concerns about contaminated food packaging, don’t use household cleaners on foods packaged in cardboard or plastic wrap. Instead, wash your hands thoroughly after handling these items. The types of UV light in sunlight (UVA and UVB light) aren’t as effective at killing germs. Additionally, prolonged sun exposure can cause skin damage, sunburns, and possibly skin cancer. You can’t prevent COVID-19 by exposing yourself to high temperatures, such as: “There is no way that anybody has ever taken a look at blowing hot air into your nasal passages in order to kill viruses,” Segal said. Segal said not only will a hair dryer not kill a virus in your nose, you could also cause serious burns if you try to heat your nose to 136 degrees. “There’s just a lot of misinformation on how to cure this disease,” Collins said. “I personally would just leave that to your medical provider.” “We are unable to find any association between the statements made by the municipal official and One America News Network,” the statement said. The statement goes on to say the network has specifically debunked the hair dryer theory. WPBF 25 News reached out to Culpepper Monday evening but did not get a response. However, OAN issued a news release saying that information did not come from their network. According to researchers, this means microbes can’t only be transferred directly from hands that are still contaminated after hand-drying, but also indirectly from that person’s body, which was contaminated by viruses blown by the jet air dryer blast. However, poor handwashing can leave hands still contaminated with viruses. Recent research finds that using jet air dryers to dry poorly washed hands can spread viruses all over clothing and surfaces. Those researchers concluded there was no significant difference between hand-drying methods. However, they were only measuring the presence of certain bacteria and not viruses like SARS-CoV-2, which is likely to be carried farther. The participant’s hands weren’t washed after contamination to simulate poorly washed hands. They were then dried using either paper towels or a jet air dryer. “The problem starts because some people do not wash their hands properly,” study author Mark Wilcox, a University of Leeds microbiologist, said in a statement. “When people use a jet-air dryer, the microbes get blown off and spread around the toilet room.” Fatigue and body aches are symptoms of both the flu and COVID-19, but the flu usually doesn’t cause shortness of breath. Experts say that if you wash your hands following the appropriate protocol, the method of drying your hands won’t matter: You’ll have scrubbed off the bacteria and viruses that could have been spread by the air dryer blast. Although both paper towels and the jet air dryer removed significant amounts of virus contamination from hands, the research team discovered there was much more environmental contamination after jet air dryer use. “We often say that handwashing is the key to preventing the spread of illness. But wet hands increase the risk of transmitting bacteria, so drying is an equally important step in prevention,” urgent care specialist Dr. Theresa Lash-Ritter told Cleveland Clinic’s Health Essentials series. New research finds that mosquitoes are more attracted to certain types of soap, increasing your risk for itchy bites. If all of that sounds way too daunting, take heart from internal medicine physician Abraar Karan of Harvard Medical School, who notes there isn't data to confirm whether washing masks every day, or every few days — or even at all — reduces the transmission of COVID-19. One last note: Wearing a mask reduces the risk of spreading COVID-19, but it doesn't eliminate it. One note: Check washing instructions before you buy. If you prefer to machine-wash, don't buy the type that requires hand-washing. After a full day out of the house: The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that masks should be washed after a day's use. Based on her data analysis, MacIntyre agrees: ""Both surgical and cloth masks get contaminated with viruses, so washing is really important,"" she says. ""If you don't wash it properly, then it may not protect you, because the contamination gets greater and greater over time."" After one day of use, her study showed viral contamination — though not with SARS-CoV-2, which hadn't yet been discovered. However, viruses can remain viable for days, she points out, and one recent study found that SARS-CoV-2 can live up to seven days on cotton. ""The point is, if you put on an unwashed mask, you may be putting on a mask which is contaminated with viruses,"" she says. That's why Karan advises avoiding the 3 C's: crowds, closed spaces and prolonged, close contacts. That will help protect the people you live with and spend unmasked time with, he says."

Chinese officials have said the virus likely originated from wild animals at a seafood market in Wuhan but it has since spread to several countries around Asia and beyond. Either way, trying to complete human clinical trials for a vaccine, which in turn is targeted at a new virus – a life form that hasn’t been around on Earth for more than a year – that in turn is spreading through a population with tremendous genetic, biological and circumstantial diversity in five weeks seems unrealistic, and is unlikely to inspire confidence in the people who will ultimately be tasked with using it. Anant Bhan, a bioethics expert based in Bhopal, pointed out on Twitter that there is no clarity on how “the clinical trial sites mentioned in the [letter’s] appendix were chosen” and how they were deemed eligible. “Was this selection done by ICMR or by [BB]? Some of these seem to be small nursing homes and hospitals; are they the apt place to run a pandemic vaccine trial?” Medical workers wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) take care of a patient suffering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Photo: Reuters/Danish Siddiqui Aveek Jayant, a clinical professor of cardiac anaesthesiology and ICU services at the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, told The Wire Science that “the first code of clinical decision-making” is primum non nocere, Latin for ‘first, do no harm’. And this, he said, “applies to vaccines even more probably than those of drugs [because] here the risks arise not only from a failure to protect … but also vaccine-induced disease or the phenomenon of antibody-mediated enhancement that could [enhance] the spectre of disease.” The August 15 timeline mentioned in Dr Balram Bhargava's letter is not just unrealistic, it suggests whatever approval follows cannot satisfy the usual requirements of efficacy and safety that the world expects from a vaccine. This was by all standards less a rapid vaccine development process and more an improper one. Many observers quickly raised multiple questions about whether such a trial could even be considered legitimate. Dr Bhargava’s announcement that the company had DCGI approval to proceed with human clinical trials for COVAXIN is also suspect. As Prem Anand Murugan wrote in The Wire, the company had received an inactivated strain of the novel coronavirus only on May 9. It’s not clear how the company could have completed animal trials, prepared the reports and had them vetted by the DCGI’s office all in the 50 days until June 29. No other information, including the trial results and the reports, is available in the public domain. And given the short span of the trial, Dr Jayant said “any subject enrolled after July 15 will not be studied enough from the immune-response point of view” – regarding harm and benefit – “within the short period of four weeks that follow. The human immune system is immune to the naïvety of our political masters and the complete spinelessness of our medical elite!” Especially since, as Dr Bhargava’s letter itself notes, work on the preclinical and clinical development of the vaccine has not yet been completed (“ICMR and BBIL are jointly working for the preclinical as well as clinical development of this vaccine.”) Bengaluru: July 2 turned out to be an unexpectedly tumultuous day for the Indian medical community. Director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Balram Bhargava sent a letter to various institutions around the country asking them to begin human clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine named COVAXIN, to be manufactured by Hyderabad-based drugmaker Bharat Biotech (BB). “Then they again left for the hospital. They got delayed because there was so much traffic. She vomited while she was in the vehicle,” he said, adding that one of her family members, a doctor, even performed CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). A police officer said several roads were blocked due to VIP movement on Friday. Both Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Governor Anandiben Patel were in the city to welcome Kovind. He said the road where Mishra’s vehicle got stuck was among the routes which had to be blocked as part of the security protocol. The Kanpur Police Commissionerate sought “forgiveness” and said the incident was “a big lesson for the future”. Tweeting from its official handle, it said the President had “expressed distress” over the death. In a tweet, the Kanpur Police Commissionerate said: “Honourable President expressed distress over the untimely death of Vandana Mishra. He called the Kanpur Police Commissioner and District Magistrate to inquire about the incident and expressed grief. He instructed the officials to ensure that his message reaches the family”. It said the officials had attended the funeral and conveyed Kovind’s message. He said Mishra had gone to the hospital on Friday morning for some tests. She returned home around 4 pm, but complained of nausea and uneasiness around 6 pm, he said. A 50-YEAR-OLD woman suffering from post-Covid complications died on her way to hospital in Kanpur on Friday evening, allegedly while she was caught in traffic for almost two hours due to road blockades that had been set up for President Ram Nath Kovind’s convoy. Hindenburg Allegations Against Adani Group - The six-member expert panel set up by the Supreme Court said it would not be possible to conclude that there was a regulatory failure on Securities and Exchange Board of India’s part in its handling of certain allegations of violations against Adani Group companies. India on Friday proposed to exclude a host of foreign investors including sovereign wealth funds and pensions funds from the purview of the so-called “angel tax”, offering the much-needed relief to the startup sector staring at a funding winter. Project Perkin Blanc: A forensic report alleging INR260 crore scam ruffles feathers at Delhi Gymkhana Club One of the limitations of the study was that the researchers relied on surrogate markers of recent asthma hospitalisation, or prescription of oral steroids that may not result in accurate identification of children with poorly controlled asthma, the authors noted. Pfizer Temporarily Suspends Sale Of These Life-Saving Antibiotics In India. Know Why Also, difficulties with access to care over the course of the pandemic may have caused asthma control to change over the two-year study period. The authors also noted that they were unable unable to account for some important factors such as tobacco exposure, unsuitable housing, and ethnicity, which may have influenced the results. As many as 752,867 children aged five to 17 were included in the analysis. While 8.4 per cent of the participants were diagnosed with asthma, 6.8 per cent had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 1.5 per cent were hospitalised due to Covid-19 infection. The authors were not able to perform a detailed analysis of nine children with most severe outcomes because they had either been admitted to intensive care units (ICU) or had died, the study noted. 'There Was No Fight Between Communities...': Manipur CM Days After Violent Clashes In State World Hypertension Day: Why Hypertension Patients Experience Exacerbated Symptoms During Cold Weather WHO Recommends Against Use Of Non-Sugar Sweeteners To Control Body Weight, Reduce Non-Communicable Disease Risk New Delhi: Children suffering from poorly controlled asthma are at greater risk of Covid-19 hospitalisation compared to those with well-controlled asthma, or non-asthamtic chidren, a new study has found. Professor Aziz Sheikh from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, said vaccine prioritisation calls for understanding which children with asthma are at increased risk of serious Covid-19 outcomes, according to a Lancet statement. He added that the analysis provides the first national evidence of the risk of Covid-19 hospitalisations among school-aged children suffering from poorly controlled asthma. Poorly controlled asthma is a condition in which a person has been hospitalised with asthma within the past two years, and suffers from symptoms such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing.

In his attempts to insinuate that state resources are being wasted, Sardesai had probably ignored that the pandemic and floods are not the CBI’s concern, but crimes are. It is notable here that TV anchor Rajdeep Sardesai has been very critical of a police investigation into the suspicious death of the actor. Earlier he had asserted that Sushant’s family should “mourn in peace” and raised objections when a police investigation was initiated. However, when he was told by IPS officers that it is the law to investigate every unnatural death, he had deflected his assertions. The only ‘claims’ of mental issues that were ‘revealed’ was by a councillor who was not medically equipped to make that decision and had breached patient confidentiality while speaking to Barkha Dutt. She added that Sushant became normal when they reached Switzerland, but things got weird while in Italy. They booked a hotel that turned out to be Gothic. She said that their room had a dome-like structure with weird pictures. She asked Sushant if he wanted to change the hotel, but he insisted on staying there. His health deteriorated and he had anxiety attacks. She said, “Then he told me that in 2013, he had a depressive episode and he told me that he met a psychiatrist called Haresh Shetty. He told me that the same doctor advised him to take the medicines he took on the flight. He told me that he was fine after that. After that, now, he was feeling more depressed and anxious. Then we cut short the trip and returned.” The only people alleging Sushant had ‘mental health issues’ are the deceased actor’s live-in partner whose involvement in the case is already under probe, and some Bollywood personalities and their media counterparts who were not even associated with the actor. #RheaChakraborty in the hot seat.

The interview is going to be aired on 27th August at 9 PM. who will answer for your nonsense article.Who will question shiv sena – the gunda party.Who will question the police cover up.Who will question the character assassination done for a family whose son was murdered. It is not independent of paid nonsense. We have failed because an election in Bihar can change the path of an investigation. And bhakts and urinary infected brains can effectively question everything because gobar gas Arnab shouts like mad. I heard someone is paying media outlets to write articles in favour of Reha and clear her image. Anyways Mumbai police initially said it was a suicide, even a normal person can say that things are not adding up. Although i don’t expect fair journalism from you guys, I’ve seen the interview of Shekhar Gupta after 2019 election. Your credibility is doubtful.  Thank you And who will question the print’s motive behind questioning those who are seeing ssr case a clear murder case? Same on you “the print”. You are clone of “the wire” and other medias who have no left for their profession. Atleast they have have the courage to speak up against the conspira y of #MahaGovt.It is understood that you guys believe in चाटु पत्रकारिता  ut you should atleast repe t the ones who are trying to get #JusticeForSushantSinghRajput .Have you sold your soul as well?!Yesterday it was #Jia today it is #Disha & #SushantSi ghRajput tomorrow there could be anyone , you or your son/daughter/wife/brother/sister etc.This.

Getting paid by Maharashtra govt and Bollywood to cover up murder. Shows how disgusting the print is !!! Print is being paid by Bollywood Mafia and Rhea to write such articles. It’s really pathetic to see that you guys can write anything for money ( North indian families can’t handle girl friends etc) and then question other journalists. I dare you to post this as you have conveniently switched off the comments. “THE PRINT” DO YOU THINK WE INDIANS ARE FOOLS.

Do something…..ask government of Maharashtra to protect him.@rahulkanwal @rahulroushan @RShivshankar https://t.co/wkPpI9DTuY In a shocking incident, a reporter from Aaj Tak news channel was physically assaulted by the father of arrested drugs peddler Zaid Vilatra in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. One Twitter user highlighted the irony of “boxer” Rajdeep Sardesai lamenting over news channels carrying out a media trial of Sushant Singh Rajput death case while his own channel also partook in the same activity. The Narcotics Control Bureau on Tuesday night arrested another drug peddler, Zaid Vilatra, from Mumbai’s Andheri in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. Zaid was arrested by the NCB and his CDR analysis revealed that he was in contact with Basit Parihar and Suryadeep Malhotra. The two have links with Rhea Chakraborty’s brother, Showik Chakraborty. Besides, Showik also had chats with the two men regarding drugs consumption and procurement. The Aaj Tak journalist was reporting from outside Zaid’s home, seeking the reaction of his parents on the arrest of their son in the high profile case of the alleged suicide of Sushant Singh Rajput. However, after initially shutting their door on the Aaj Tak reporter, Zaid’s half-naked father opened the door and aggressively pushed and shoved the journalist while hurling choicest of abuses at him. Boxer talks and tweets so much about media harassing people and then media house where he works does this .. kuch bol iske bare me Maddison boxer @sardesairajdeep https://t.co/Kx98jykhI2 Another Twitter user asked “boxer” Rajdeep Sardesai to ask Maharashtra government to provide security for his colleagues. Soon after the video of the assault went viral on the Internet, netizens reminisced the ugly brawl that took place at the Madison Square in New York years ago when India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai had displayed his exemplary boxing skills to attack a Modi supporter. The incident took place in 2014 when Modi was supposed to address Indian diaspora at Madison Square in New York. Rajdeep Sardesai had exchanged blows with a Modi supporter after the former’s needling questions in relation to Gujarat riots 2002 and the United States’ denying Modi visa, earning him the monicker ‘boxer’. One of the Twitter users suggested Aaj Tak send “boxer” Rajdeep Sardesai next time to fend off attacks from truculent respondents. “I am telling you one thing. Understand it. Get out of here. Get out of here you bas***ds,” Zaid’s father said menacingly while pushing the Aaj Tak reporter. “G*ndu, boxing batau kya,” he said. “Why should such liars, fake news peddlers, convicted criminals and fixers be allowed to practice journalism? They should be banned from Journalism and their Padma awards taken back”, Sinha wrote. In her petition, she writes, “Rajdeep Sardesai was recently convicted in court of Peddling fake news and he has accepted and apologized. Barkha Dutta is infamous for her Niira Radia fixing audio tape. Do you think these people deserve to keep their Padma Awards?” Recently, Sardesai had issued an unconditional apology to an IPS officer for spreading fake news in 2007 in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case. Similarly, Barkha has also been accused of one-sided reportage. Recently, she came under fire after the Jamia ‘sheroes’ she glamorised turned out to be terrorist sympathiser and called India a fascist state for executing terrorist Yakub Memon. Her reportage of 26/11 Mumbai terror attack also came under fire for endangering the lives of 100s of civilians. IIMA alumni Anubha Sinha started a petition on Change.org to PM Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and India’s President Ram Nath Kovind appealing them to withdraw Padma awards of controversial journalists Barkha Dutt and Rajdeep Sardesai. Sardesai and Dutt have been time and again accused of peddling one-sided narrative and sometimes misreporting. Recently during Delhi anti-Hindu riots, Sardesai tried to pin the blame of BJP leader Kapil Mishra but locals dismissed it by saying how Mishra is not to be blamed. In January, ahead of Delhi elections, he shared fake news on Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally and deleted tweet twice when reality was pointed out. In fact, after almost two decades, Sardesai even admitted that PM Modi was not responsible for 2002 riots as Gujarat chief minister and that the media had sensationalised the riots. Love Fraud is a four-part docu-series about a con man, Richard Scott Smith. The show follows the search for Smith, who over the past 20 years used the internet and his dubious charms to prey upon unsuspecting women looking for love. He conned them out of their money and dignity. Smith's victims band together to seek revenge by turning to a bounty hunter when they feel that the justice system has failed them. Watch it if you like crime thrillers. The docu-series started streaming on Voot Select from August 28. “It’s deeply unfair,” Greta Thunberg thundered in a tweet about the decision to hold the exams in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. So what else is happening in this movie? The NCB is probing a drug angle especially after Rhea's WhatsApp chats with Jaya Saha about certain illegal drugs were found, Gaurav Arya, a peddler is under the scanner and possibly a larger cartel could be exposed soon. This, apart from the ED investigating the money-laundering, and the CBI investigating the death itself. Nothing significantly new, really, just another week, and what seems to be turning more into a riveting web series rather than just a movie. Now, Rasode ki mystery is resolved but who will be the new chief of the Congress party? At the crucial Congress Working Committee meeting on Monday, Sonia Gandhi offered to resign as the Congress interim president. She asked the committee to initiate the process for selecting a new party chief as high drama ensued. Sonia Gandhi will continue as the interim president for now after a majority of the party’s state units slammed the letter by 23 senior party leaders seeking a rehaul of the party organisation and demanded that Rahul Gandhi if not Sonia should continue to lead the Congress. Not just the Congress party, but it has been a difficult week for students as well amid the decision to conduct the Joint Entrance Examination- Main (JEE) and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) in September as scheduled. Students want the exams to be postponed. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is in support of the students. So is Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and at least six other non-NDA chief ministers. Woh sab toh thik hai lekin Rasode mein kaun thaa? Haan, Raashi Ben thi but the internet isn't satisfied with the answer. Yashraj Mukhate's Kokilaben rap has gone so viral that people can't get the tune off their minds. We don’t blame them. It’s the same case here as well. It’s deeply unfair that students of India are asked to sit national exams during the Covid-19 pandemic and while millions have also been impacted by the extreme floods. I stand with their call to #PostponeJEE_NEETinCOVID— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 25, 2020 If you have seen the hour-and-a-half interview, we want to tell you about the other topic that's taken over the country this week: Rasode mein kaun tha? You can decode that mystery while keeping yourself warm with a cup of kadha, the recipe of which Bhagyashree has for you. From the bookshelf, our pick is Paulo Coelho's The Spy, on THE Spy, Mata Hari. In his own words, Bhatia described ScoopWhoop as “the place which eventually treated me with such utter disdain that this post is how I have to say goodbye and try and find some closure.” In his social media post, the journalist narrated that he was assaulted. “I do not wish to take names in public forums. This is not my disagreement with the policy of taking names publicly. It is simply the path that I have chosen for myself for now,” he said. The former ScoopWhoop journalist was mocked for his biased coverage of West Bengal polls. Popular Twitter user (@HashTagCricket) stated, “Scoopwhoop’s “unscripted” West Bengal video looks more scripted than the interview Rhea Chakraborty gave to Rajdeep Sardesai.” Another Twitter user pointed out the obnoxious analogies drawn in the video to suggest that BJP was weak and fragile in Bengal. Bhatia spoke out against the indifference meted out to him by ScoopWhoop. “After the trauma of what happened came the other traumatic experience of how the organization chose to deal with it and how they continue to do so since they have made a clear choice to side with one of the senior-most people in the organisation.” Bhatia spoke out against the indifference meted out to him by ScoopWhoop. ""After the trauma of what happened came the other traumatic experience of how the organization chose to deal with it and how they continue to do so since they have made a clear choice to side with one of the senior-most people in the organisation."" It must be mentioned that Samdish Bhatia came under fierce criticism from feminist groups over the ‘shocking’ and ‘satirical’ portrayal of marital rape in a video titled, ‘Delhi on Marital Rape’. An article by Feminism in India stated, “In the first 20 seconds of the video, Producer Samdish Bhatia attempts to satirise the sensational news coverage format. Bhatia also seems to be in character through the video, not objecting to or reacting with disgust to any of the egregious comments made by his subjects. He is good at interviews. But that does not defend the editing which also seems to take on that misogynistic character.” The guy is literally comparing Mamata banarjee’s rally with A local Candidates road show to Make people believe that BJP is a flop show in WB. Matlab hadd ki bhi hadd hai. The man behind the ‘ScoopWhoop Unscripted’ show also lamented about the space he created at the company, besides the unfinished projects that now lie in hard disks. In October last year, Bhatia had informed about his decision to quit the company through an Instagram story. “I am no longer a part of ScoopWhoop Unscripted. I am telling the truth. Even though the resignation has not been accepted, I am out for good. This is what I want to say at this point.” “The low point that I experienced after the incident was unimaginable. I refuse to go there again just to be able to articulate what I felt then. Let’s just say – I was down and out, did not want to work or face the camera anymore, did not want to exhibit any kind of energy and I did not see any hope of getting out of there. It is at this point that my one true partner stood up and took complete care of me,” Bhatia pointed out. Three months after quitting Delhi-based digital media company ScoopWhoop, journalist Samdish Bhatia spoke out about his ex-employer’s indifference to an alleged incident of assault that resulted in a traumatic experience. Hours after psephologist and republic TV journalist Pradeep Bhandari was manhandled and slapped by a fellow ABP journalist, Rajdeep Sardesai wasted no time in downplaying the assault and engaging in victim-blaming. Referring to the security provided to Bhandari, he ranted, “An image which perhaps defines the Tv media in ‘Banana Republic’ times.” While casting aspersions about the integrity of Pradeep Bhandari, Sardesai indirectly justified the attack as a ‘sign of lost respect’. With dwindling TRP ratings and frequent social media criticism of their bias, India Today is caught in a state of fix. Instead of course-correction, the news channel has been up-in-arms against its rival Republic TV. The motivated campaign has been spearheaded by two ‘ace’ journalists, namely Rahul Kanwal and Rajdeep Sardesai. In a bid to settle scores and placate their inflated individual egos with media baron Arnab Goswami, the duo has been further damaging the credibility of their channel – India Today. On 8th September, Kanwal wrote on his Twitter account that while “Banana Republic” channels are questioning India Today’s integrity for interviewing Rhea Chakraborty, they are hounding Rhea across Mumbai city desperately hoping that she will talk to them. “India Today got an interview you wanted,” he added and compared Arnab Goswami with Nazi leader Joseph Goebbels. But amusingly, while on one side the India Today journalists were seen casting aspersions on the government for using the actor to distract the public’s attention from the larger issues and whining about the unnecessary media coverage being given to Deepika Padukone’s summon, their own journalists were stationed in Goa, covering Deepika Padukone’s minute-by-minute update. On Thursday, Rahul Kanwal took to Twitter to raise concerns over ‘digital privacy’ and the issue of ‘private Whatsapp chat leaks’, pertaining to the chats that had resulted in the NCB summons for Deepika. He wrote, “The leaking of private Whatsapp chats raises serious questions about privacy? Many have been wondering how was NCB able to access Deepika Padukone and Karishma’s private chat?” Kanwal further inquired, “Can someone be forced by agencies to share passwords with help retrieve deleted chats?” The leaking of private Whatsapp chats raises serious questions about privacy? Many have been wondering how was NCB able to access @deepikapadukone & Karishma’s private chat? Can someone be forced by agencies to share passwords with help retrieve deleted chats? #Newstrack 8 pm Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor, and Rakul Preet Singh were summoned by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Wednesday in a Bollywood-drug nexus case. India Today’s Rajdeep Sardesai alleged that the government was using Deepika Padukone as a distraction from major issues like the Farmers Bill. Rajdeep Sardesai took to Twitter to hint that Deepika Padukone’s summons by the Narcotics Bureau on September 25 was somehow connected to the farmer’s protest. Failing to condemn the fact that a fellow journalist has been attacked, Rajdeep took the incident as an opportunity for scoring goals, to pontificate that Republic TV may have better TRPs, but it is losing ‘respect’. The passive frustration of losing in the TRP race to a ‘New’ channel was visible again. He claimed, “When a ‘noise’ channel hires private security to ‘protect’ their so-called reporter from fellow journalists: it’s a sign of the channel having lost the most precious TRP: TV RESPECT POINTS of your peers!” Dear @indiatoday, @aajtak and @aroonpurie, can you give this to your newsdesk with our compliments and tell them to take a chill pill? They seem a little too stressed. pic.twitter.com/SbTok5Bw4D All this began after police started investigating a possible case of money laundering in connection with actress Rhea Chakraborty -- who is a Bengali. Police investigation taking its course wasn't enough for netizens, who unleashed their wrath on the actress in the form of vicious name-calling and undisguised misogyny. This shows how journalism in the country is in a sorry state. Taking to Twitter, journalist Rajdeep Sardesai wrote: ""This is beyond amusing: it's bizarre. all this while 'noise' channels created a TRP driven 'insider' Vs 'outsider' narrative for Sushant suicide. Now, it's shifted to 'gold-digger' girlfriend! We might as well turn our studios into courtrooms where we prosecute without evidence!"" The controversy around Rhea Chakraborty was only an excuse to bring to the fore, yet again, society's persistent interest in attacking people of certain communities, stereotyping them, ridiculing and harassing them and trying to make them bow down to intimidation and pressure. These jibes surfaced hours after reports of Sushant's family alleging that Rhea had performed black magic on the late actor. Had the issue been restricted to netizens, we might as well have blamed it on their ignorance and lack of reasoning. However, journalism hit a new low as Aaj Tak aired a show titled ""Sushant par Rhea ka kaala jaadu"". Controversies around the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput have refused to die. Only now, the issue has taken a ridiculous turn with trolls taking to social media to mock Bengali women for apparently possessing mystical powers and performing black magic. This is beyond amusing: it's bizarre. all this while 'noise' channels created a TRP driven 'insider' Vs 'outsider' narrative for Sushant suicide. Now, it's shifted to 'gold-digger' girlfriend! We might as well turn our studios into courtrooms where we prosecute without evidence! These discussions are not just senseless but laughable at the same time, and it is difficult to come to terms with the fact that people in this era still believe that stereotyping a particular community, calling them names and trolling them could serve justice to a deceased person. Not stopping here, netizens went on to begin a kind of hate campaign against Bengali women, who, as per their understanding, are ""gold-diggers"", ""manipulative"", ""dominating"", and ""bish kanya"" (poisonous daughter). Bengali women are also sorcerers who ""use their husbands for ATM"" and ""ruin men's careers"". Although the hate campaign in question is against only Bengali women, the fact remains that the male-dominant society has for decades been using black magic as an excuse to pull down assertive, opinionated women, asking them to mend their ways. In a recent interview with Cricbuzz, he shared his opinion on MCC’s newest decision to rephrase ‘Mankading’, legalising the law as ‘run-out’. “My response is - about bloody time!!,” he had told Cricbuzz from a London hospital."

But more worryingly, data showed that Bihar had one of the highest unemployment rates in the age-group of 15-29 years — 30.9 per cent in 2018-19 as against 22.8 per cent in the year-ago period. That’s the voter Tejashwi Yadav was targeting with his promise of 10 lakh government jobs. With 74 seats, the BJP has emerged as the second-largest party in Bihar assembly, one short of the RJD’s 75 and a good 31 seats more than its ally the JD (U), which won 43 seats. This marks the beginning of a shift in Bihar politics where Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a national leader, seems to have overshadowed the regional satraps. The Modi wave that had swept the country in the 2014 Lok Sabha election had lost its steam just a year later when Bihar voted in the 2015 assembly election. The vote was widely seen as Bihar’s rejection of the national trend that was clearly visible in the state in 2014. Lalu used V.P. Singh-Mandal gambit to expand his base. About 15 years later, Lalu became Bihar’s Chief Minister and his party remained in power till 2005. Since then it has been Nitish, who empowered the Extremely Backward Class (EBCs) — communities that Lalu could not reach out to. How important Bihar is in national politics goes beyond numbers. And it was visible on the day of counting. On 10 November, India was glued to TV and mobile screens, following the vote-by-vote update. The 16 hour-long counting was like a rollercoaster ride with its ups and downs — a final before the IPL final. The results, yet again, put to test the veracity of exit polls that had given the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) led Mahagathbandhan a clean sweep. At the end, with NDA’s win, 31-year-old Tejashwi Yadav was unable to create history by becoming the youngest chief minister of Bihar. Over the past two months, Bihar has witnessed yet another political change. Although the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, led by Nitish Kumar, is set to return in Patna, the 2020 assembly polls have given birth to new political equations. In fact, the shift was underway for quite some time. Bihar, which witnessed a near-uninterrupted Congress rule for decades until the 1990s, saw the rise of regional players in Lalu Prasad Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal and Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United).

Shehbaz Sharif also faces serious corruption charges similar to his elder brother. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had frozen 23 properties belonging to Shehbaz Sharif and his son, Hamza in December 2019 accusing them of money laundering. The NAB arrested him in the same case in September 2020 and he was released on bail in April 2021 by the Lahore High Court. 9. He became the Punjab CM again in 2008, returning from political exile after almost a decade. 2. Shehbaz Sharif had been serving as the Chief Minister of the crucial Punjab province of Pakistan for the previous three terms. He said, “Today, every citizen of India is under extreme stress due to inflation. Diesel has touched Rs 90 per litre today against Rs 54 in 2014. Petrol was Rs 60 in 2014, now it is Rs 110. CNG was Rs 35 per litre, now it is Rs 75. The LPG cylinder costed Rs 410, now it costs Rs 1153. Vanaspati Oil was Rs 70 per litre, now it is Rs 170. Salt prices doubled from Rs 7 to Rs 15. It is impossible for the aam aadmi to run their household today. All the tax collected is being spent on only two things. First, waiving off loans to help their super-rich friends and second, to buy MLAs."" He also appreciated his MLAs for foiling Operation Lotus and questioned the illicit source of its funding. He said, “When this gimmick made them fall flat on their faces, they targeted our MLAs. 12 of our MLAs have told me that they have been offered Rs 20 crore to switch sides and if they bring 2-4 MLAs with them, they will get Rs 25 crore. Or else, they will have the same fate as Manish Sisodia."" ""Their (BJP) fight is not against corruption, 'Operation Lotus' is a method of grabbing power by deceit. So far, these people have brought down the governments of Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Arunachal, Manipur, and Meghalaya. They have bought out 277 MLAs so far. If we assume the lower side of 20 crores per MLA, then they have spent at least Rs 5,500 crores so far in horse-trading,” the CM said. ""The FIR states that one vendor paid Rs 1 crore to another vendor through a bank transaction, what has Manish Sisodia got to do with their trade? The CBI raided Manish Sisodia’s house for 14 hours, but couldn’t find a penny to incriminate him,"" he said while noting that the raids on Sisodia's residence came ahead of Gujarat polls and allegations would be revoked if they announced that AAP would not contest elections. ""They have kept Rs 8 hundred crores somewhere and are running ‘Operation Lotus-Delhi’. Everyone is curious about where these Rs 8 hundred crores are and who got them such a whopping amount? I will reveal in this Assembly who got them these Rs 8 hundred crores,"" Kejriwal said. “People are saying all of this is happening due to the Gujarat elections; if we step back from the fight, all the cases will be closed,” the CM argued. “The public knows when AAP comes to power in Gujarat in December they’ll get BJP’s 27-year-long rule audited, due to which we face investigation over investigations at present,"" said the Delhi chief minister. Other exit polls have projected a close contest, with the Grand alliance having an edge. According to Times Now-CVoter exit poll, the BJP-led NDA, in which JD(U) is in alliance, is expected to get 116 seats while the Grand Alliance is projected to get 120. The Republic TV-Jan ki Baat exit poll, on the other hand, has projected a greater lead for the Mahagathbandhan, which is expected to win as many as 138 seats. While the  India Today Axis Poll has projected as many as 161 seats for the Opposition, much more than the NDA tally of 91 seats, CNN News 18-Today’s Chanakya has predicted 55 seats for the NDA and 180 for the Mahagathbandhan. Despite the pandemic, Bihar saw a considerable voter turnout with Phase 1 recording 54% votes –– marginally lower than 54.75 per cent for the same 71 seats in 2015 elections. Similarly, Phase 2 witnessed 55.7% voter turnout as compared to 56.17% recorded last time. India Today Axis Poll predict: 47% young voters (18-25 years) said they voted for the Mahagathbandhan, while 34% said they voted for the NDA. The pattern changes among those older than 50 years, with 45% of the voters saying they voted for the NDA, and 40% voting for the Mahagathbandhan. While the RJD-led Grand Alliance has a clear advantage in the Seemanchal belt, Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, which is contesting 16 of its 20 seats in this phase, may cut into its vote base and even register wins. With 7.3 crore voters, the Legislative Assembly election in Bihar this time was shortest Assembly election in 15 years. Polling were held in just three phases, as opposed to five in 2015 and four in 2005. In a state that has always been watched for what its social and political undercurrent signify, Election 2020 is being keenly watched. It is India’s first mass polls in the shadow of the pandemic, and Bihar’s first in a long, long time without either Lalu Prasad or the just deceased Ram Vilas Paswan present. Nitish Kumar, meanwhile, has conceded much ground in his alliance with Narendra Modi’s BJP. 55.22% voter turnout recorded till 5 pm in the third and last phase of Bihar assembly elections: Election Commission of India The third phase polling for the 243-member Bihar Assembly ended at 6 pm. All eyes will be now on the exit polls. Findings of various exit poll surveys for the first major election in the country amid the pandemic will start trickling in after 6.30 pm. Stay tuned! The third phase voting for the 243-member Bihar Assembly concluded at 6 pm. The majority mark is 122. Hoping to return to power in Bihar, the NDA is facing its toughest contest in 78 constituencies that voted on Saturday, including Seemanchal (Kishanganj, Araria, Katihar and Purnea), Kosi (Supaul, Saharsa and Madhepura), Mithila (Darbhanga and Madhuvani), and Tirhut (Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi) regions of the state.

Candidates for 41 of 57 Rajya Sabha vacancies which are to be filled up in this slot of biennial elections have already been elected unopposed in other states in which NDA has won one seat less than their previous number. All 200 Rajasthan MLAs had cast their vote for the Rajya Sabha elections by Friday afternoon. The counting of votes for the four seats will start at 5 pm. As a cloak of nervousness blanketed the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi and Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, voting for the six Rajya Sabha seats with seven candidates started briskly here on Friday morning.

In the Assembly elections held in February-March in Manipur, BJP had won absolute majority with 32 seats while National People's Party (NPP), another ally of the NDA, emerged second with seven seats. JD (U) won six out of 38 seats it contested while Congress came fourth with just five seats. JD (U) extended its support to N. Biren Singh government even as BJP got absolute majority. BJP, however, did not accept NPP's offer to be part of the government. This increased BJP's tally in Manipur to 37 in the Assembly of 60. ""This is not the first time they have done it.

Speaking to The Wire, TMC MP Saugata Roy said, “BJP is parachuting its Delhi leaders in, to control Bengal. This clearly shows they don’t trust their Bengal leaders.” Basu further added, “The fact that they say Rabindranath Tagore was born in Bolpur [where he actually set up his school] or garland a different person’s statue saying it is Birsa Munda, or celebrate when Vidyasagar’s statue is vandalised, it indicates a lack of knowledge and more importantly the insensitivity towards Bengalis in general.” Also read: Armed With Doles, Mamata Banerjee Is Out to Counter BJP’s Popularity Among Her Lost Voters Ajay Gudavarthy, assistant professor at the Centre for Political Studies, JNU, however, believes the regionalism narrative has its own limitations. “Outsiders’ (BJP in this case) developmental pitch is likely to puncture the regional pride narrative put forth by the Trinamool,” he said. In order to create a sense of fear among people over a non-existent danger to Hindus, BJP has pushed various narratives. The state chief famously once said that TMC is turning “West Bengal to West Bangladesh.” Associate professor of political science at Jadavpur University, Imankalyan Lahiri, says, “BJP is pushing an aggressive Hindutva narrative which is alien to Bengalis.

The same is being repeated now with Mamata Banerjee. Why has BJP not given a full cabinet berth to any of its Bengal MPs? Their sole aim is to control Bengalis so that we remain subservient to them.

Should Bengalis accept leaders from other states, imposed on them?” On a number of occasions, the West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has herself called the BJP an “outsiders’ party.” The latest was on Wednesday, in her first election rally at Bankura, around 200 kilometres from Kolkata, where she blazed all guns at the saffron party and said, “Some people were sent to Bengal from Delhi. These are not people from Bengal. These are outsiders. They will snatch whatever you have.

Hope this puts a rest to all speculations,” Abhishek said as he ruled out an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party, which is also trying to open an account in the coastal state before the election. Talking to ThePrint, the Goa MLA added, “I have quit Congress for a reason. I will fight them in Goa next year. This time, it is going to be a straight fight between BJP and Trinamool Congress as the people of Goa are really upset with the BJP. And the Congress has failed them in 2017, when the party could not form government despite winning 17 of 40 seats.” Kolkata: As chaos in the Congress became more prominent Wednesday with the G-23 publicly calling on the leadership to take stock, Trinamool Congress’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee also targeted the national party, saying it “does not work, does not hit the street and loves to remain in the comfort of their homes”. The barbs by the Trinamool leader, who is also West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, came on a day the party inducted Luizinho Faleiro into its fold. Faleiro, a Goa MLA and former CM, was a senior leader with the Congress. “If Congress chooses to be silent against BJP, we cannot be expected to be sitting ducks. We want to defeat the BJP. We have been defeating the BJP in the last seven years. Congress has been defeated by the BJP in the last seven years,” said Abhishek at the induction ceremony. Abhishek is the first senior Trinamool leader, apart from CM Mamata who was once a Congress leader, to attack the Congress directly. “I will not criticise Rahul Gandhi and our party president (Sonia), but I see a leader in Mamata, who has fire when she quits Congress and she has power (sic),” Faleiro added. The party leader, along with his former poll strategist Prashant Kishor, has been instrumental in poaching Congress leaders such as Sushmita Dev, who joined the Trinamool in August. Abhishek is also known to be close to Congress’s G-23 leaders, such as Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal. Both Singhvi and Sibal have fought cases for the Trinamool and the Bengal government in the Calcutta High Court and the Supreme Court. Refusing to comment on this development, Abhishek said, “It is for the Congress leadership to answer about the grievances and issues the G-23 leaders are talking about.” Former Goa chief minister and veteran Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro, who resigned from the party today, said that he sees absolutely no hope or even the will to prevent the collapse of the grand old party in the state. In his resignation letter to party president Sonia Gandhi, Faleiro said that the Congress in Goa was not the same for which he had sacrificed and fought. He said the party was functioning contrary to every ideal and principle of its founding fathers upheld by Indira Gandhi, and Rajiv Gandhi. Former Goa Chief Minister and MLA Luizinho Faleiro in his resignation letter to Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi writes, ""I see absolutely no hope or even the will to prevent the collapse of the party and change for the better"". pic.twitter.com/BU15Fz8GRq Today, Faleiro submitted his resignation as an MLA to the Speaker of Goa Assembly after he resigned from the Congress party in Goa. “Rahul Gandhiji too has been uncompromising in his fight against the forces that seek to destroy the fabric of our nation. However, the Goa unit of the party has become a cruel parody of what the Congress stands for. Led by a coterie of leaders who prioritise personal gains over the responsibility we owe to our people, we have utterly failed to even be an effective Opposition,"" he said. The Congress leader claimed that he wanted to stake a claim to form the government but he was prevented. ""I see absolutely no hope or even the will to prevent the collapse of the party and change for the better,"" he wrote to Gandhi. ""Today, Congress family is fragmented. On one side we have got Mamata-Congress, YSR-Congress, Sharad Pawar-Congress. Congress is divided. Congress is weak,"" Faleiro said while addressing a press conference today. There have been speculations that he will join Trinamool Congress led by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The TMC tried its luck in the 2014 Lok Sabha election too. This time, former CM Churchill Alemao was its face. Alemao lost the election from South Goa constituency. The TMC did not contest the 2017 assembly election. Team members of I-PAC, run by Mamata Banerjee’s political strategist Prashant Kishor, have stationed themselves in Goa. They have been meeting MLAs, former MLAs, heads of religious groups, social activists and prominent citizens to get a sense of the political situation in the state. On the contrary, the Congress is struggling to find an acceptable face against CM Pramod Sawant. With Faleiro’s resignation, the Congress’s strength in the assembly has come down to four. Out of them, two are believed to be in touch with the BJP. Faleiro, 71, had called Mamata a “street fighter” on September 27 while tendering his resignation as an MLA. “Goa is going through difficult times, and it needs such fighters, who are of the same wavelength, same party ideology, policies, principles and programmes,” he told reporters in Panaji. He claimed he had suffered dignified silence in Congress. “I am a Congressman and in the larger picture, I would like all Congress parties to come together and fight the next parliamentary elections.” Political observers believe Faleiro will harm the Congress more than the ruling BJP. He will eat into the Congress vote base among the Catholics, helping the BJP indirectly. The Congress is already under pressure to join hands with the GFP to avoid a division in the non-BJP vote. The TMC has been trying to get a foothold in Goa since 2012. Interestingly, the party banked on all former CMs in its mission. In 2012, the TMC poached three-time CM Wilfred D’Souza and projected him as its face. D’Souza had built the Congress in Goa but eventually fell out. He joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 1998 and was its Goa president from 1999 to June 2009. Under him, the TMC contested 20 seats in 2012 but lost all. Former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on September 29 in Kolkata in the presence of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. Faleiro, who quit as Congress MLA from south Goa’s Navelim, reached Kolkata on September 28, along with his supporters, to a rousing reception by the TMC. Two senior ministers in the Mamata government, including Sujit Bose, and Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen welcomed Faleiro. Faleiro had promised that the Congress will not field a candidate against Vijai Sardesai, chief of GFP, in Fatorda. However, he did not keep his word. Sardesai won the election comfortably and extended the support of his three MLAs to the BJP. This support was crucial as the Congress required only three more MLAs to form the government. “Mamata Banerjee expressed her views. We cannot interpret that. We raised our voice against the politicisation of these agencies. She spoke about the entire BJP misusing the agencies,” said TMC chief whip Nirmal Ghosh, who had moved Monday’s resolution in the assembly. “Such resolutions are against the rules and regulations of the assembly. Earlier resolution against the BSF (Border Security Force) jurisdiction has also not yielded anything. She is only trying to please the PM,” said Adhikari. Kolkata: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s sudden apparent change in tone towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created a buzz in political corridors, with the leader of opposition in the state assembly Suvendu Adhikari telling reporters Monday that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief was trying to “please” the PM. Also read: After Jawhar Sircar slams ‘corruption’ in TMC, fellow MP Saugata Roy says he should resign Meanwhile, Congress MP and West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury called the Trinamool the weakest link in the opposition against the BJP and said: “There is a tacit understanding between the BJP and TMC and now it is out in the open”. The West Bengal CM’s generous exemption of Modi from the criticism directed at the BJP Monday by her has, therefore, raised eyebrows, with rival parties like the CPI(M) and Congress calling her out. “Modi is a liar… PM is a liar”, the CM had said while addressing a gathering in the run-up to the elections, before amending her statement and saying, “Liar is an unparliamentary word. The Prime Minister is misleading the people.” “Mamata Banerjee is trying to get the PM’s sympathy by saying BJP leaders are triggering ED and CBI action. But there’s no point as the PM has taken a tough stand against corruption and has a zero-tolerance policy in place as well,” BJP MLA and chief whip Manoj Tigga told ThePrint. Sixty-four Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs opposed the resolution which claimed that these agencies were being “politically misused” by the BJP. The Trinamool is no stranger to CBI and ED action against its members — from CBI probe into alleged TMC involvement in post-poll violence reported after the declaration of last year’s assembly elections (which the BJP lost to the TMC), to investigations into alleged scams involving TMC leaders and West Bengal ministers. “Certain facts have emerged over the past few days and certain perceptions have developed in the public. Considering the present circumstances, we would like to give the ‘benefit of doubt’ to the public perception and not to the party leader,” said Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and the party’s all-India general secretary, after convening a meeting of the party’s disciplinary committee that Chatterjee himself used to chair. He said that he was confident that neither the BJP’s high-voltage communal campaign nor the Union government’s ‘use of the ED and CBI for political purposes’ can help the BJP bring Mamata Banerjee’s government down. “Corruption is the party’s principal threat at present,” the MP said. “Didi Ke Bolo kept leaders at various levels under pressure of being observed by an invisible mechanism. Certain complaints drew the party’s attention to wealth illegally amassed by a section of leaders at the grassroots level and the party took steps in sidelining these leaders gradually,” said a veteran TMC MLA, adding that the campaign “died down” by the time the 2021 assembly election approached, as priorities changed. The BJP’s state unit president Sukanta Majumdar said that the TMC was trying to turn Chatterjee into a scapegoat to save other top leaders. “Who will believe that Partha Chatterjee alone was involved in this scam?” he asked. However, taking quick action against Chatterjee is not going to give the party any relief in the longer run, as corruption has evidently been a problem deeply rooted in the party, ironically led by a politician who had given up her Union minister post in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government after a scam hit defence minister George Fernandes. Her modest lifestyle – Banerjee still lives in her small, ancestral home and wears a plain saree and slippers – has been her biggest political capital. On July 28, the chief minister first stripped Chatterjee of all his ministerial portfolios – parliamentary affairs, industry and commerce, information technology and industrial reconstructions – and then the party announced his removal from all organisational positions and suspension of his primary membership until he proved himself innocent. The Sarada chit fund scam and the Narada sting operation had both hit the TMC badly, with the Supreme Court ordering CBI investigations into both. However, perhaps because neither hit the TMC politically – possibly due to a vacuum in the opposition space – the TMC never cared to take any step towards checking corruption, at least through measures that were visible to the public. Despite the scam breaking out just a few days before the 2016 assembly elections, all the ministers and MLAs seen in the sting video allegedly accepting cash won from their constituencies, except for one. To overcome the loss of people’s trust, Banerjee announced a crusade against corruption in her own party. The party’s political opponents, the BJP, the CPI(M) and the Congress, however, have repeatedly dubbed such mechanisms as mere eyewash, and tools for turning grassroots level leaders into sacrificial lambs to save senior ones. It was found out while analysing the election results that people showed their anger against the TMC for limitless corruption at the grassroots level and the loot of votes in the 2018 panchayat election. BJP had pegged their electoral campaign largely on targeting the TMC over corruption. Terms like “cut-money” – meaning illegal cuts TMC leaders allegedly took from beneficiaries of various projects – and “syndicate raj” – indicating the rule of a real estate syndicate which arm twisted commoners with the support of leaders of the ruling party – were in the air. Before that, interacting with members of civil society, Banerjee claimed she had suggested to the Congress that an advisory council of prominent personalities from civil society be set up to give a direction to the opposition, but it was “in vain”. “Have faith in your cadre. Three farm laws were repealed [by the Union government] and a debate was not allowed in parliament. Why? Because they are afraid and the decision to repeal was made with an eye on the coming Uttar Pradesh elections,” she said. “We want to say BJP hatao, desh bachao (remove BJP, save the country),” she said, adding that her Trinamool Congress (TMC) party will not contest assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. When asked if she wanted Pawar to be the chairperson of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), Banerjee, who was accompanied by her nephew Abhishek Banerjee, said, “Three is no UPA now.” New Delhi: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar in Mumbai and called for the opposition to unite to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while taking thinly veiled swipes at the Congress leadership. Banerjee’s remarks like “there is no UPA now” and that nothing can be achieved by “staying abroad most of the time” were seen as targeting the Congress and the Gandhis. Banerjee also slammed the BJP for alleged misuse of laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). “The UAPA is for internal security and protection from external forces. This is not for common people. The UAPA is being misused like anything. The I-T department, CBI, ED are also being misused,” she said. Earlier, during the meeting with civil society members, Banerjee also mentioned the “victimisation” of prominent Bollywood personalities such as Shah Rukh Khan. To a question, Banerjee said the TMC will not allow the BJP to grow in the states where the Congress “is not fighting”. “You have to be on the field to defeat the BJP,” she said. Meanwhile, Pawar – whose NCP is in a coalition with the Congress in Maharashtra – said leadership was not an issue at present and all like-minded parties were welcome to join the fight against the BJP. A: What else should I say? I have come to overthrow Mamata Banerjee’s government. We can rule only when we uproot Mamata Banerjee’s government. Why should I say I will preserve Mamata Banerjee’s government? It’s not performing well, that is why I say the people of Bengal will overthrow this government. By India Today Web Desk: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that his party’s goal is to overthrow the Mamata Banerjee government from West Bengal, and there’s no sugar-coating it. Q: When we asked Mamata Banerjee today why she got angry on Jai Shri Ram slogans at PM event, she said she didn’t get angry at Jai Shri Ram chants but rather at slogans being raised in the name of a leader. But the BJP said that I left the event because of Jai Shri Ram chants. Q: But Mamata Banerjee is saying that BJP is disrespecting farmers by calling them anti-national and andolan jeevis. Q: Does this mean Mamata Banerjee is right when she says that the BJP is seeking to contest polls on religious and emotional issues? A: I don’t know why Mamata didi gets irked by Jai Shri Ram. The Trinamool’s attempts to interpret this slogan as a religious call are incorrect. Had this been a religious call, Bengal would have never accepted it. The anger behind the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ chant is directed at appeasement and vote bank politics of the Mamata Banerjee government. This chant is the slogan of change. A: Maybe only Mamata Banerjee heard those slogans. Every media house, including yours, reported that she was irked by Jai Shri Ram chants. Q: Opposition is saying that the government is not ready to discuss farm laws in Parliament. Q: We asked the same question to Mamata Banerjee. She said Amit Shah says we will uproot Mamata government, ‘will that not anger me’?"

Following is a timeline of the key dates around Hong Kong’s protest movement triggered by a now-abandoned extradition bill: February – Hong Kong’s Security Bureau proposes amendments to extradition laws that would allow extraditions to mainland China and other countries not covered by existing treaties. Sept. 2 - Lam says she has caused “unforgivable havoc” and would quit if she had a choice, according to a recording of remarks to business people. Oct. 29 - Authorities disqualify pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong from standing in upcoming district elections. May 28 - President Donald Trump orders his administration to begin the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong, but stops short of calling an immediate end to privileges that have helped the territory remain a global financial centre. April 17 - Beijing’s top representative office in Hong Kong says it is not bound by a law restricting interference by mainland Chinese bodies, stoking concerns over China’s encroachment. Aug. 9 - China’s aviation regulator demands Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific suspend personnel who have taken part in the protests.

The region will once again see peace after Armenia immediately withdraws from the Azeri lands it is occupying,” Erdogan told an event in Istanbul. Earlier, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Armenia must send back foreign “mercenaries and terrorists” to achieve stability in region. He did not directly address whether Turkey was currently playing an active role in the conflict, as Armenia has said. Azerbaijan denies the claim. ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday Armenia must immediately withdraw from territory he said it was occupying in Azerbaijan, and it was time to end a crisis over the breakaway region after clashes between Azeri and Armenian forces. Azerbaijan “had to take matters into its own hands whether it likes it or not,” Erdogan said. “Turkey will continue to stand with...Azerbaijan with all its resources and heart.” “I thought that the children shouldn’t fall into our rut. They should be pushed ahead,” he said. Indian states including Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat said in May they were looking to relax workers’ rights, including weakening regulations on wages and working hours, to support industry. That proposal drew criticism from workers’ unions and the ILO. The amendments have only taken effect in some states. Even so, Kumar and another worker Reuters spoke to said they didn’t feel safe to return. His parents grew increasingly worried. “Whatever little money I had here in the bank, I sent some of that so he could eat,” said his father, Ashok. “At that time, I was very scared. The biggest challenge was for him to come home.” On June 25, Dream Plast India sent him an email, which was seen by Reuters, asking him to report to work within four days or face termination. Instead, he resigned on July 20. A chance conversation with a cousin who had studied plastic engineering got him hooked, Kumar said, and he started researching. In Dutta Nagar, where there were no internet connections, that often meant asking one of a handful of locals with a smartphone to Google the opportunities. “I want to start a business of my own,” he said, explaining how he wants to recycle plastic to make day-to-day products at his own factory. Kumar’s ambitions were a world removed from his father Ashok’s early years. The 47-year-old, who assists with weighing and pricing grain harvests, remembers when the family had neither enough food, or proper clothes. Kumar first heard of the coronavirus in early March. When India’s lockdown forced Dream Plast India to temporarily shut its plant in Baramati on March 21, he had enough cash to wait it out in town. Trump considered invoking the act in response to violence and looting at mostly peaceful anti-racism protests in June. Trump dropped the idea after public pushback from Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Right. Under the Insurrection Act, if a president determines that a rebellion has made it “impracticable” to enforce U.S. law through ordinary judicial proceedings, he may activate the armed forces without a governor’s approval “to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.” “When a president claims that the facts on the ground warrant invocation of the Insurrection Act, courts ordinarily would not second-guess this,” Chesney said. Judges, however, could break with precedent if they believed Trump had relied on false claims to justify the use of force, he said. SO TRUMP NEED NOT HAVE A GOVERNOR’S APPROVAL FOR SENDING IN TROOPS? The Insurrection Act, an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act dating back to 1807, permits the president to send in U.S. forces to suppress a domestic insurrection. Trump, who previously declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he decides Tuesday’s election results are fraudulent, could bring in the military or federal agents to quell civil unrest on Election Day. If Trump sends in DHS or other federal agents, they must respect the constitutional rights of civilians. Advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union accused the agents in Portland of making arrests that violated the constitutional rights of protesters and journalists. EU officials said policymakers have not yet confirmed which specific car CO2 targets the Commission will propose. Biden has pledged to end the program if he wins in November.

She said she hopes that a Biden win will make “everything normal” again. But seeking the repatriation of someone who has already been deported would require an order from a judge to reopen the case, a complicated legal process, immigration attorneys said. Biden has said he would lift the travel ban if he is elected. But Abdi and Montakhabi are affected by other policy changes, too. Anez and Aguirre’s chances for U.S. protection also hinge on the fate of another Trump rule, one that barred asylum for almost anyone who transited through a third country and did not seek refuge elsewhere first. It was struck down in federal court and is now on hold, but that ruling could still be overturned by the Supreme Court. The girls went to stay with Maynor, who was living with his girlfriend and his newborn at the time.

Now, many immigrants are in a new phase of uncertainty, waiting to see who will win the November presidential election - Trump, or his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. Trump plans to expand and solidify his changes to the immigration system in a second term, while Biden has vowed to undo many of them if he wins. “In the future, if there is something unsatisfactory... we request organizations to send a complaint to the press council first instead of opening a case or suing,” it said in a statement that welcomed the army’s decision. After publication, the army said its artillery fire had not killed the women or caused other civilian injuries and blamed insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA), who are fighting for greater autonomy in Rakhine state. The AA blamed the army. The army did not comment on whether the case against him had also been withdrawn. Maung Kyaw Zan told Reuters he had heard nothing about his case so far. The press council, which adjudicates disputes between authorities and news media, said the army had withdrawn the case against Reuters and a lawsuit filed last year against an editor for local news website The Irrawaddy. The army subsequently filed a complaint to the press council objecting to the article. It later brought the criminal defamation case against Reuters and the lawmaker, Maung Kyaw Zan. The army held a news conference on Feb. 4 to complain about the story, after which Reuters updated the story to reflect the army’s position. The army filed a complaint against Ye Ni, an editor for The Irrawaddy, in April 2019 also over coverage of conflict in Rakhine state. Ye Ni said he was “very pleased” with the withdrawal of the lawsuit and the reasons given by the military. Police in Rakhine state, where the case was filed, were not available to confirm the case had been withdrawn. Wall Street banks had sent workers home in mid-March to help stem the spread of the virus, but that proved disruptive for some heavily regulated or technology-intensive functions, such as trading and other compliance roles.

Hours after former Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi had posted a tweet showing his support for the convicted terrorist Yasin Malik and seeking UN intervention in the matter, Indian cricketer Amit Mishra reminded Afridi that Yasin Malik himself had been pleaded guilty in the court and asked him to verify before jumping in support of the terrorist. Indian leg-spinner Amit Mishra took a brutal dig at controversial former Pakistan cricket team captain Shahid Afridi over his recent statements supporting the terror convict. Under the sections under which a case is registered against Yasin, he can get a maximum punishment of lifelong imprisonment. Yasin Malik has been active in Kashmir politics. He is one of the key instigators and secessionist leaders in the Kashmir valley. Malik has been in jail since 2019 as a part of the crackdown against the anti-India and secessionist elements in the Valley in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack. He was later remanded to the NIA custody and was shifted to Delhi’s Tihar jail from Jammu’s Kot Balwal jail. In April, former cricketer Irfan Khan had tried peddling false propaganda on Twitter over communal incidents, especially after Muslim mobs had attacked Hindus at several places across the country. Kashmiri separatist terrorist Yasin Malik was found guilty in a terror funding case. On 10th May 2022, Yasin Malik pleaded guilty to all charges, including those under the stringent Unlawful Activities and Prevention Act (UAPA), before a Delhi Court in a case related to terrorism and secessionist activities in Jammu and Kashmir that convulsed the Valley in 2017. Yasin Malik had admitted that he was involved in terrorist activities, had also hatched criminal conspiracies, and that the sedition clauses against him were also correct. Abhinav Sekhri, a lawyer who practises in Delhi and focuses on criminal law and procedure, said that while the registering of FIRs is in fact as per law—a Supreme Court judgement mandates police stations to file FIRs on receipt of a complaint—the question that arises is whether India’s judicial processes are robust enough to establish a false case to be false. On 3 June, a day before Zubair had to travel to UP to file an affidavit, an office bearer of the Hindu Sher Sena threatened to burn an effigy of him, claiming again that Zubair had made offensive comments about Hindu gods and goddesses. Asked whether the Alt News team lives in fear that one of them may be arrested, co-founder Pratik Sinha cited the arrest on 20 April 2022 of Congress legislator Jignesh Mevani by an Assam police team that travelled all the way to Gujarat, and the long incarceration of former students’ union leader Umar Khalid. Every time he calls out hate speech, drawing attention to their own statements, extremist Hindu right-wing handles accuse him of citing quotes out of context or tampering with videos, and then urge Hindus to call for his arrest. According to M N Reddi, a former Bengaluru police commissioner and a Karnataka director general of police, repeat offenders in hate speech cases should be restrained by police using provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), 1973. In 2018, Pratik Sinha received a phone call during which the caller simply said,  “Likhna band karo warna goli maar denge. Stop writing, or we’ll put a bullet in you.” Sinha and Zubair have both received threats from people sliding into their direct messages on social media. “Then his community’s jihadis get ready to attack those he has targeted,” Narsinghanand said, going on to claim that Zubair was responsible for Nupur Sharma’s troubles and for the case against Jitendra Tyagi, an accused in the Haridwar Dharm Sansad (religious parliament) hate speech case of December 2021. “This Zubair is the one who is trying to get everyone killed.” The only available remedy was to approach the SC for an order clubbing all the investigations in one police station. The remedies have not kept up with the times and do not offer succour to those hounded by multiple law enforcement agencies for a single act, he said. These groups were part of an ecosystem that runs online campaigns and files real-life cases against journalists they consider inimical to the ruling party. Meanwhile, Zubair continued to receive emails from Twitter informing him of police enquiries about his tweets exposing hate speech. The latest was from the Mumbai police, who appeared to have received a complaint about a video clip he tweeted on 7 April, in which a priest is seen threatening to rape Muslim women. The video appeared to have been shot in the vicinity of a mosque. 3:4: Then those who reject Faith (Kafaru) in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severest penalty, It is, therefore, ironic that the India-Pakistan match started with “taking the knee” and ended with a racial slur that Blacks have suffered through for centuries. It is frankly pointless asking why the Indian cricket team did not bother showing solidarity with Hindus who were being massacred in Bangladesh or the Hindus who die in India regularly simply because they are Hindus, but since the Indian cricket team felt the need to fight against the American flag, the American national anthem and the racism pandemic in the USA, how is it that the ‘wokes’ have failed to apply the same Lexicon control and change parameters to Muslims. One has to wonder after reading this, whether the alternate meaning of ‘Kufr toot gaya’ really matters. Is it not natural for people, especially indigenous people and polytheists to immediately connect the word “Kufr” to the violent meaning in the Quran, given that they have been persecuted time and again because the Muslims deemed them so throughout history? 9:3:  And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans(Mushrikeen). If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith (Kafaru). (Mushrik and Kafir treated as same), As for the Indian team and their management, one can chart their woke activism to their monumental incomprehension and ignorance. Notwithstanding the actions of the dull-witted Indian cricket team and its management, the fundamental question remains – will the BLM activists, reformists and global Woke cabal now campaign to outlaw the word “Kafir”? And if they do, what happens to the Quran? How will they reconcile their pattern of shielding Islamists and fighting for the rights of the Blacks if they end up campaigning against the word Kafir? Or will they look away because the Islamist amalgamate is far more important than outlawing racial slurs that have been used to persecute Hindus and Blacks alike? These questions could very well be rhetorical since we know the innate hypocrisy of the Global Woke fraternity, but they must be asked nonetheless. While ‘kneeling’ is a phenomenon that African Americans have followed since the Civil Rights Movement to show inherent lack of respect for the anthem and the flag of the USA, another distinct feature of the current Black Lives Matter movement was Lexicon control that was not just advocated but even implemented in several aspects. Was Margaret Mitchell, who wrote this novel in the 1930s, being deliberately racist? Perhaps not. Was it written with the explicit intent to offend African Americans decades after it was released? Probably not. But the BLM activists insisted that the racist undertones of the movie offended those who had suffered the consequences of American slavery. Two weeks after the movie was pulled down, it made a comeback with appropriate historical disclaimers explaining the context of the scenes set in the early 1900s. Patently, therefore, the movement has paltry little to do with India. The racial tension in the USA between the blacks and whites has no parallel in India even though brown-sahibs like Professor Ashutosh Varshney would like to equate the Blacks in the USA with the Muslims in India. The religious tension in India has its roots in centuries of oppression by the Muslims of the indigenous Hindu population – from the Mughals killing and converting “Kafirs” by the sword to the modern-day religious crimes like Grooming Jihad, riots and widespread violence against Hindus being observed. In fact, one of the criticisms that accrued to the Indian Cricket Team was that they failed to show solidarity with crimes against humanity far closer to home, like Hindus being persecuted in Bangladesh, and chose to show a gesture that pertains to a fault line that finds no relevance in India. Pakistani commentator said “Kuffar to toot hi gaya” (the non-believers has been been finally destroyed). Babur in reply says, “Yeh allah ka karm hai” pic.twitter.com/FpQiKVFAu9 8:38: Say to the Unbelievers (Kafaru), if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), their past would be forgiven them; but if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them). He had also sought the intervention of the then Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh over Khalistani posters in the city of Amritsar. Instead of clearing the air over the Khalistan controversy, AAP party leader Raghav Chadha tried to intimidate the poet into silence. An FIR was registered against Kumar Vishwas, which was put on hold by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Once again agenda behind protest is Exposed. Khalistan, Terrorist Bhindrwala gang should be arrested and sent to Jail https://t.co/vI5cy6risF According to him, Kejriwal had once claimed, “Either I will become Chief Minister of the state or I will become first Prime Minister of an independent nation (Khalistan).” Vishwas had alleged that deep-rooted separatism had engulfed Kejriwal’s mind in his quest for power. Although the FIR was later withdrawn, it soon surfaced that the Aam Aadmi Party-run-Punjab government had constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the ‘provocative remarks’ of Tajinder Bagga. Last month, AAP leader Raghav Chadha attempted to give a clean chit to Khalistani extremists in Punjab after they attacked Hindu shopkeepers and pelted stones at a Kali temple in Patiala. Although the frenzied mob was caught on camera raising ‘Khalistani Zindabad’ slogans and brandishing swords, Chadha claimed it was a clash between workers of two political parties. Bagga did not stop exposing the underlying connections between Khalistanis and the Arvind Kejriwal-led party. He had pointed out how AAP leader Harpreet Singh Bedi had been actively demanding a separate nation for Sikhs. It is not a stretch to imagine that the AAP government in Punjab is trying to hunt down Bagga not because of some tweets against Kejriwal but actually because he is exactly what threatens AAP in Punjab - A proud Sikh man vocal against Khalistani terrorists and AAP's divisive politics. While speaking about the development, BJP IT Cell Chief Amit Malviya wrote, “Arvind Kejriwal’s brazen misuse of Punjab police to target political opponents is not unexpected. He had been raging for this. But this won’t go down well. We will fight to secure every single karyakarta of ours and ensure that Kejriwal learns how to handle power the hard way…” Ahead of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha elections this year, former AAP leader Kumar Vishwas had revealed how party supremo Arvind Kejriwal was in cahoots with the anti-India forces to grab power in the Northern State. Earlier, Delhi Police issued look out circulars against the farmer leaders who were named in a first information report registered in connection with the violence that broke out during the tractor parade on Republic Day.

Delhi Police has put up notice outside Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait's tent at Ghazipur border. pic.twitter.com/OzRQM8tJKJ Farmers will be evacuated forcefully if they do not vacate the site, reports The Hindu. The political activist said he was scared of going back to Manipur because he feared the state government would file more serious charges against him even if the court were to dismiss the sedition case. “This is what the government did to a journalist after the court said sedition charges don’t hold,” he said, referring to Kishorechandra Wangkhem, a Manipuri journalist who was charged under the National Security Act in 2018 after he posted a Facebook video critical of Biren Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On July 14, Leichombam had also written a post on the “serious allegations against the chief minister of Manipur” levelled by Thounaojam Brinda, a police officer from the state. In an affidavit to the court, Thounaojam has alleged that Chief Minister Biren Singh had tried to foil a police investigation against a fellow party member accused of smuggling drugs. In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, the political activist posted: “I have been charged with sedition by the government for exercising my freedom of speech. To protect Kangleipak from a forceful assimilation is a duty. I will not stop writing. You can’t gag all your critics. Some of us still love our homeland. You can imprison my body, but how will you imprison my mind?” The police in Manipur have filed a sedition case against political activist Erendro Leichombam, the chief of Imphal East police station Jogeshchandra Haobijam confirmed to Scroll.in on Tuesday. The police have refused to divulge more details about the case, but Leichombam said when officers visited his home in Imphal on July 26, presumably to arrest him, his family members were told that the charges stemmed from his Facebook posts.  Leichombam’s family claimed that the police referred to a particular picture he had posted on July 24 about Sanajaoba Leishemba, a newly-elected Rajya Sabha MP and the titular king of the state. The police have also invoked Section 153 (causing provocation to riot) and 505 (public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code against Leichombam. The activist is the convenor of a Manipur-based political party, People’s Resurgence and Justice Alliance, which he had co-founded with Irom Sharmila in 2016 after she ended her 16-year-old fast for the removal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from Manipur. He had contested the 2016 Manipur Assembly elections, but lost. Leichombam, who has a postgraduate degree in economic policy from Harvard University, is a vocal critic of the current BJP dispensation in Manipur. He was arrested in 2018 for posting a video on Facebook that the police said amounted to “promoting enmity between different groups and criminal intimidation”. “I have been targeted because I am a long-time critic of the BJP government in Manipur,” Leichombam said. In addition to Wangkhem, several Manipuri civil society activists and political activists have been detained or arrested over the last couple of months for allegedly criticising the BJP government on social media. Tasleema Narsin had said that if situation of Muslims in India is bad like that of Hindus in Pakistan, they will leave India. The fact that they have not left India show you are talking  bull. If Vietnamese come, they are likely to be beaten up for looking Chinese.  If Indonesians and Malaysians come, they will assaulted for being Muslims, under the current climate. In The Print, there was one article stating how India is trying to raise the number of foreign students from ASEAN. At a road show, the Vietnamese ambassador said Vietnamese students are afraid to come to India due to incidents of rape.   Now what will you reply to him ? Will you ask what about Moplah ?  Or say that Harsh Mander and liberals should be shot for giving a bad image of India ?  Or will you say that BJP’s mob violence has brought India down with rape and killing, and the problem to be tackled is the RSS ? Secularist,  unlike you I not only read about India, but most of the major events in world.  I am not one with limited knowledge like Akash or Kili brainwashed in their Jihadi or  armchair revolutionary ideas. You secualrist have tried to brainwash India by false narratives through paid agents like Romila Thapar or Ifran Habib. The Print reports that last year, the government launched ‘Destination India’, which seeks to project the country as a hub of education.   The govt. held some meetings with ASEAN countries to find out how to attract more international degree students.  The Vietnamese ambassador said in his country, students are scared to come to India because they have read about rape and lack of safety for women. Indeed, in Aug 2019, when Amit Shah thundered in Parliament that India would recover all of Kashmir that was controlled by Pakistan as well as the Aksai Chin region which Pakistan had ceded to China, well, all hell broke loose. External Affairs Minister Jaishankar had to fly to Beijing to throw oil on troubled waters and assuage the Chinese that Shah was not being serious. Indeed, US International Affairs experts such as Tom Fravel point out that the Chinese response in Galwan was a direct response to Arun Shah’s loose lips, see ref: bit.ly/30ZH0Yq When you are not able to answer or deny the pogrom Modi organised in 2002 that Kili refers to, you ask ‘what about Moplah’ ?   What about it ?  That was done in British India.    You will have to investigate British rule, and the Hindus and Muslims of the period, to understand it. Sanyal made another point, which is that the government will pick and choose, and not allow FDI into sensitive sectors, such as in the rollout of the 5G network. For all practical purposes, Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, won’t be welcome. He could have added the media to the list. Modi understands that if India wants to be taken seriously on the world stage – like China – it must become lean and mean, perform or perish. So India will soon clear FDI proposals, including that by Chinese automakers despite the PLA troops still engaged in a border standoff with the Indian Army in Ladakh. As you brilliantly point out, if India tries to copy China, it would end up like Pakistan – no democracy and no development and Hindu Ayothollahs like Adithyanath running the show. In a statement, Maria Arena, the chief of the panel, said that protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act have led to “arbitrary detentions and an unnecessary loss of life”. She said that journalists and peaceful critics were being arrested under “draconian counter-terrorism and sedition laws”, adding that the authorities were targeting human rights activists. “In the absence of action by India’s authorities since the outbreak of the violence, I strongly support the call for a prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigation into all human rights violations committed by law enforcement officials. There should also be a fully independent, public and transparent inquiry into the role of the police in failing to prevent the violence that broke out and even aiding it.” The European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights on Monday cautioned India against targeting religious minorities in the country, particularly Muslims. It urged the Narendra Modi government to meet its pledge to promote and protect human rights. The move was widely criticised by various organisations. The United States, the United Kingdom as well as the European Union have also raised concerns about the government’s investigation into Amnesty International India. India has defended its decision, saying that other countries should not “condone contravention of Indian laws by any entity”. In her statement, Arena also expressed concern that human rights group Amnesty International India was forced to halt work in the country. On September 29, the organisation had accused the Centre of having frozen its bank accounts as punishment for speaking out about alleged rights abuses. On September 23, Progressive International, a global organisation, had also condemned the government for targeting dissenters and protestors “known for their decades of social, political and democratic work” and charging them under anti-terror and national security laws in cases pertaining to the Delhi violence and the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon incident. “It is high time for India to translate words into action,” she said, requesting the European Union to address these concerns within the EU-India Human Rights Dialogue. Last month, over 200 eminent personalities had urged the government to release former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Umar Khalid and all those falsely implicated for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act. A statement was released by pioneering linguist Noam Chomsky, leading American philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler, scholar Homi K Bhabha, writers Arundhati Roy, Meena Kandasamy, Rajmohan Gandhi, Amitav Ghosh and Salman Rushdie, filmmaker Mira Nair, historian Irfan Habib, journalist P Sainath, and actor Ratna Pathak Shah, among many others. The signatories expressed concern at the arrests of democratic voices in India. AAP leader Tahir Hussain in his confession during the interrogation of Delhi Police said that Khalid Saifi, who is very close to him, planned the riots with him. He once told him that his political position and money should be used against Hindus and for the community. He promised Saifi that he will always be ready to take any step. After the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ram Lalla Virajman and the Indian government passed Citizen Amendment Act tabled by Home Minister Amit Shah, Tahir and Khalid met and decided that this was time they have to act. The Delhi court had also asked the Delhi government to file a status report relating to the issue of pendency of sanction in the JNU sedition case to prosecute Kanhaiya Kumar and others. There was a significant blame game going on over the demolition of the 100-year-old Hanuman temple in Chandni Chowk in Delhi with VHP blaming the Aam Aadmi Government in the national capital for not protecting the Temple against demolition at the Delhi High Court. According to reports, in the year 2020, the Delhi Police urged the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government to clear their pending request for prosecuting controversial ultra-left wing leader Kanhaiya Kumar and others in connection with the JNU sedition case. In a letter released by the SFJ, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the chief of the anti-India outfit, made a sensational allegation that the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP treacherously used Khalistan votes and funds to win Punjab. Most notably, former AAP leader Kumar Vishwas recently made explosive allegations against Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party. Vishwas had said that Kejriwal and AAP party were consorting with separatists and terror sympathisers during the run-up to the Punjab assembly elections in 2017. He also insinuated that people sympathising with the Khalistani cause visited Kejriwal at his residence ahead of the 2017 assembly elections. Kejriwal, who has always tried to portray himself as a devout Hindu, had another awkward encounter ahead of the 2020 Delhi elections when he grossly misquoted the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita. Taking a sly dig at their ideological opponents-BJP, he said that it is written in Gita that a true Hindu is brave and never runs away from the field. The ‘devoted’ Hindu was unaware that throughout the 700 Sanskrit verses in Bhagavad Gita, the word “Hindu” has not been used anywhere. While Tejasvi Surya, BJP Yuva Morcha president and MP from Bengaluru demanded an ‘unconditional apology’ from Delhi Chief Minister, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma urged Kejriwal to not be “anti-Hindu openly. Ahead of the 2019 general elections, Kejriwal had shared an image where a man with a broom can be seen hitting the Swastika symbol, a symbol holy to Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. The opposition parties also contributed to the mess by spreading fake news about the farm laws and creating a sense of hysteria among farmers in Haryana and Punjab. When the government warned that Khalistani elements were making attempts to hijack the protests, it was accused of maligning the farmers. The criticism is especially focused on the use of Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, a preventive detention law, under which journalists Aasif Sultan, Fahad Shah and Sajad Gul have been kept jailed despite being granted bail in separate cases by courts, the Committee to Protect Journalists said. “Imprisoning journalists is just one measure of how authoritarian leaders try to strangle press freedom,” the report said. “Around the world, governments are also honing tactics like ‘fake news’ laws, are using criminal defamation and vaguely worded legislation to criminalise journalism, are ignoring the rule of law and abusing the judicial system, and are exploiting technology to spy on reporters and their families.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said that the data highlighted that repression of minorities was another theme behind the arrests. It said that in Iran Iran and Turkey, both of whom were classified as “worst offenders”, it was Kurdish journalists who bore the brunt of government crackdown. Officials say she died of heart attack while in custody but critics believe she was physically assaulted on accusations of violating the hijab mandate. In China too, another “worst offender”, many imprisoned journalists belonged to Uighur ehtnic group from Xinjiang region. The report said that the key driver behind “authoritarian governments’ increasingly oppressive efforts to stifle the media” was to cover up the discontent in the society affected by the coronavirus pandemic and the economic fallout of Russian invasion of Ukraine."

These messages — declared as “fraudulent and fake news” by the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying — have resulted in both demand and prices tanking. The hit from a price crash, triggered by unsubstantiated fears over poultry meat posing the risk of COVID-19 infection, is currently being largely borne by the integrators. They are the ones that lift full-grown broiler chickens from poultry farms and sell to traders, who further supply these to retail shops in urban as well as rural markets. Since late last week, Hinge Patil’s company has taken the extreme step of transporting live birds from farmers’ poultry sheds in pick-up vehicles for selling directly in retail markets in and around Ambegaon. In early January, farmgate prices of broiler birds in Maharashtra were ruling at over “BOILER CHICKEN ME KORONA VIRUS KO PAYA GAYA HAI. TAMAM LOGO SE APPEAL KI JATI HAI KE BOILER KE GOSHT KA ISTEMAL NA KARE…. MUSLIM COMMUNITY MUMBAI. KHAR. DUAA KI Appeal.” Rough translation: “There is a coronavirus in the broiler chicken. Thus, everyone is informed to avoid consuming broiler chicken. (Muslim community, Khar, Mumbai)” It is noteworthy that the outbreak of Coronavirus has given rise to false messages on social media attempting to build a narrative against the consumption of meat. Earlier, a video of an exotic meat market in Indonesia was shared as a ‘dirty’ marketplace in Wuhan, China – the epicentre of CoV epidemic. Another video related to the 2019 African Swine Fever outbreak was also linked with CoV. “High alert: Chicken infected from corona virus found in Bangalore today, kindly circulate the message and avoid consumption of chicken. Spread to your dear ones.” China culled around 18,000 chickens in Shaoyang city in the southern province of Hunan as a result of a flu outbreak, amidst the coronavirus epidemic. Social media rumours in India started circulating, mostly in Marathi and Hindi, that the broiler chicken has been infected with Coronavirus and people should avoid consuming it. A Facebook user Jits Scenic has posted images of chicken with the message, “Carona virus has been found in boiler chicken.Request to all of you not to eat boiler chicken.And please share it everywhere.” Carona virus has been found in boiler chicken.Request to all of you not to eat boiler chicken.And please share it everywhere In parallel to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the Chinese government has now confirmed another highly pathogenic strain of the H5N1 bird flu in Hunan province. The 18,000 chickens that had been culled in Shaoyang city in the southern province of Hunan were due to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak, as confirmed by China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. The 18,000 chickens were thus culled due to H5N1 avian flu, and not the Coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). While thoroughly cooked chicken remains safe for consumption, a large number of human infections with the H5N1 virus have been linked to home slaughter and improper handling of infected or dead chicken carcasses before cooking. H5N1 and Coronavirus are two distinct infections, where H5N1 rarely infects people-people, Coronavirus is most infectious if people get in contact with those who are infected. From 2017-2021, Dr. Shaikh was the Founding-Editor for Alt News Science. Her main role is as a neuroscientist researching violent extremism and psychiatry. The Indian poultry industry is fervently opposing allowing any access to imported chicken meat, especially frozen leg pieces, from the US. But it has a more immediate problem at hand, having to do with the novel coronavirus originating from China and causing estimated losses of $1 billion. Since early-January, farmgate prices of broiler birds in Maharashtra have crashed from over Rs 80 per kg to Rs 30-32 levels, driven purely by fears over poultry meat consumption posing the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. This, despite the Union Animal Husbandry Commissioner Praveen Malik clarifying, in a communication dated February 10, that poultry products have “not been found to be involved in transmission of 2019-nCov (novel coronavirus) to humans so far in any report globally”. He added that past outbreaks of coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2002-03 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012-13) or corona-associated common colds “had no involvement of poultry or poultry products world over”. In the United Kingdom (UK), a second person dies of the coronavirus, Reuters reported, while the Vatican reported its first case, One Vatican official was put into a protective quarantine after a priest from France's Catholic church in Rome tested positive for the virus. The official is not showing symptoms of COVID-19 disease but lives in the same church as the infected priest. A man from New Delhi with a travel history to Thailand and Malaysia tested positive, earlier in the day. The Centre, meanwhile, said it was fully prepared to bring back the Indians stranded in Tehran and Qom on special Air India flights. After China, Iran is one of the worst affected countries in terms of positive coronavirus cases. As fear about coronavirus spreads in the city, doctors from the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) assert that taking adequate precaution is the best way to tackle the disease. Dr J S Thakur from the department of community medicine and school of public health in Chandigarh at PGIMER claims that as of now there is no cure and set treatment for the disease. Therefore, precaution is the best way forward. “The best and most effective precaution is, as WHO has highlighted, wash your hands thoroughly and regularly, and make sure to maintain distance from those who are coughing, sneezing or showing any other sign of being sick with some sort of infection,” Thakur says. “Handwashing is 90 per cent of your work done in terms of protecting yourself from the disease.” Read more... In the first impact of coronavirus on diplomatic engagements, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not travel to Brussels to attend the India-EU summit, which has been postponed amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The summit was scheduled for March 13. The first coronavirus cases struck the EU institutions on Wednesday. An official at the general secretariat of the EU council of member-states tested positive for COVID-19 following local transmission in Belgium. On Thursday, the Ministry of External Affairs’ official spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, “With regard to the proposed India-EU Summit, both sides have agreed that due to health authorities advising against travel between regions, it would be wise to reschedule the Summit to a later mutually convenient date. The decision has been taken in the spirit of the close cooperation between India and the EU who share the same concerns and commitment to global health and hope that the outbreak is contained soon.” The Beating Retreat ceremony at the Attari-Wagah border in Punjab will be conducted without public presence due to coronavirus, the Border Security Force said. The precautionary measure will be effective from Saturday. A day after a 26-year-old man working at the Paytm office in Gurgaon tested positive for coronavirus, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the district said the samples of four others who worked closely with him have also been sent for testing. The office in Gurgaon’s Sector 54 is closed, and 91 other employees found asymptomatic have been home quarantined. CMO Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said the man who tested positive is a resident of Delhi and had gone to Italy for his honeymoon trip. He got himself tested at RML Hospital on March 2 as a precaution upon his return. “He did not show any symptoms but has been isolated at AIIMS,” said the CMO. The Delhi government, meanwhile,  has directed schools to suspend the morning assembly in view of coronavirus. The upcoming combined shooting World Cup in New Delhi was on Friday postponed, while an Olympic test event in Tokyo stood cancelled due to the global novel Coronavirus outbreak, news agency PTI reported. The tournament, sanctioned by the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), was to be held from March 15 to 25 in the capital's Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range. The World Cup of shooting has been postponed amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has also impacted the Olympic preparations of the country's top athletes. The event was to be held from March 15 to 25 in Delhi, while an Olympic Test event in Tokyo, scheduled from April 16, stood cancelled. Further, clips of a programme titled 'can a person contract coronavirus by eating chicken' aired in a TV media have made the matters worse. The footage of the programme is doing the rounds on social media, triggering panic among meat-eaters, the aggrieved poultry farmers complained. The poultry farmers associations in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra have lodged complaints against the rumour mongers with cyber police. The Ministry of Agriculture has launched awareness campaigns in those states. But the poultry farmers here are not organised because of which they are suffering, Raghu Pawar said and urged the Animal Husbandry department to come to the poultry farmers' rescue. WhatsApp and Facebook are flooded with false messages triggering panic among meat-eaters. The sudden drop in sales of broiler chicken and eggs has hit the poultry industry badly. ""Normally, chicks develop Ranikhet disease, a viral infection affecting the respiratory system, with high mortality rate. A few people are creating false alarms by posting the pictures of chicks with Ranikhet disease on social media platforms. Because of such false posts, business has gone down by 30 to 35 per cent,"" laments Parashuram Pawar, a poultry farm owner in Guledgudda. Hundreds of poultry farmers in the district have been hit by sudden dip in sales following the false alarms on social media that chickens are transmitting coronavirus (COVID-19). That and subsequent circulars — including by Malik’s Maharashtra counterpart Sachindra Pratap Singh, who, on February 20, even filed a complaint with the cyber crime cell of Pune police against social media posts linking the COVID-19’s spread with chicken meat — have had little impact on the ground, though. “This was entirely thanks to the misinformation campaign via WhatsApp and Facebook. The majority of chicken consumers in India aren’t regular non-vegetarians and they wouldn’t really miss not eating it for a month. In this case, they had a reason, right or wrong, not to consume. The effect of it is, of course, being felt by farmers,” said Srilankeshwar Waghole, general manager of Bhairavnath Poultry Farms Ltd, which operates in Pune and Satara districts. The Indian poultry industry is fervently opposing allowing any access to imported chicken meat, especially frozen leg pieces, from the US. But it has a more immediate problem at hand, having to do with the novel coronavirus originating from China and causing estimated losses of $1 billion. Since early-January, farmgate prices of broiler birds in Maharashtra have crashed from over Rs 80 per kg to Rs 30-32 levels, driven purely by fears over poultry meat consumption posing the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. Several messages say broiler chicken is found to have the virus. There is no scientific evidence to prove Covid-19 spreads through eating chicken, mutton or seafood. No doctor or researcher have said so. A Unicef message says the warning against ice cream and cold food can lead to one getting infected, is unfounded. This message is credited to the Chinese doctor Li Wenliang who raised an alarm about the virus in Wuhan and later died of it. It is false. Stanford University has rubbished this claim and tweeted: ‘Misinformation… falsely attributed to Stanford is circulating on social media and in email forwards. It is not from Stanford. Official information from Stanford is available at http://healthalerts.stanford. edu.’ A viral post pushing home remedies says ‘steam inhalation helps eliminate coronavirus.’  Steam inhalation can clear a blocked nose, but the WHO does not recommend it as a remedy for the pandemic. It clearly says there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new virus. In a tea-consuming nation, messages like ‘Who would have known that a simple cup of tea would be the solution to fight this virus?’ are particularly misleading. Several fake posts about staying safe during the pandemic are doing the rounds. Metrolife identified some widely circulated ones. While this news may be a delight to share, it is fake. Several laboratories across the globe are testing and working hard on a vaccine but the news of it being ready for use is not true. Messages that say ‘Gargle or drink hot liquids to kill coronavirus’ stand no scrutiny. Several examples like hot water and lemon, hot water and salt, and even ‘rasam’ are being cited as liquids to beat the virus. Among several fake self-tests recommended to see if you have Covid-19, a risky one tops the chart. Vijay More, Managing Director of Amir Chicken, said that ever since coronavirus started spreading, a rumour had started floating that eating chicken caused  the viral infection. To counter rumours  that the coronavirus infection is linked to consumption of poultry products, Pune-based organised meat retailer Amir Chicken and Eggs Pvt Ltd has announced a prize  of ₹5 crore to anyone who can prove that eating chicken and eggs causes  the deadly infection. Nashik-based broiler-farmer, Deepak Bhor said that chicken is a cash business for the farmers, which gives them immediate returns. But today there is a huge decline in the prices of the birds. In Maharashtra, the poultry industry has taken a major hit due to the virus scare. Some reports have pegged the losses at about ₹700 crore due to low demand for chicken and eggs. Various associations have been demanding a bailout package for the poultry sector. In the last 10 days, several farmers and poultry-farm owners have culled their chickens and destroyed egg stocks due to fears over  the coronavirus infection. The cost of production today  is about ₹70 per kg but retail  prices have crashed to ₹10. “How can the business sustain in this environment?,” More asked. He said  the company trains youths from drought-prone areas of the State  to run franchise operations. It creates self-employment and the consumers get clean and hygienically packed meat. It is this business opportunity that is being destroyed by rumours, fake news and malicious social media posts, said More. The police have also started taking action against such fake news articles. The financials of Angul district poultry farmers is so bad that they are now resorting to non-conventional and eerie marketing tactics to woo buyers. Residents here said that the farmers are beating drums and announcing ‘exciting offers’, even doling out chickens for free as the demand has hit ‘an all-time low’. However, the residents are difficult to be lured even with free offers. Social media platforms such as WhatsApp and YouTube are rife with rumours and fake news of chicken being infected with coronavirus. The impact of rumours is such that the government had to intervene last week to allay the fears. The Animal Husbandry Ministry has said that poultry was not found to be involved in the transmission of coronavirus to humans in any report globally. Pasupati Feeds’ Angul branch manager, Ramakanta Swain, said, “Due to the fear of spread of COVID-19 infection, people in the district are not ready to buy the chickens. For which, our company has been incurring losses.” Notably, Angul district has a sizeable poultry sector; the numbers of chicken farms are more under Bantal and Kanihan police station limits.

New Delhi: The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagatbandhan in Bihar is consciously avoiding bringing up the India-China stand-off in its campaign for the upcoming assembly election as it is wary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holding the advantage on the subject of national security. “The template is very clear — don’t make the state election about national issues, especially issues pertaining to nationalism, Pakistan, China or anything to do with national security. The opposition parties realise that whatever may be the reality, the public perception is that the Modi government has managed to stand up to China,” said Rahul Verma, fellow at Centre for Policy and Research and co-author of Ideology and Identity: The Changing Party Systems of India. Experts say the opposition’s decision to not drum up China or the border stand-off is in line with a “template” that has become popular among non-BJP parties in the recent assembly elections held in Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi. The opposition alliance is keeping its distance from the border stand-off issue while Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to the ‘Bihari pride’ in June when he launched the ‘Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan’. a government scheme aimed at boosting employment opportunities for migrant workers. “The minute we bring in that issue, BJP will find a way to invoke nationalism and start thumping their chests again and distract from the actual issue, so it is best to avoid that,” a senior Bihar Congress leader told ThePrint. “This can be a national issue for national leaders to focus on, but for state leaders, our focus is entirely on local issues,” the Bihar Congress leader quoted above said. “The template also includes not pitching a state election as a battle against Modi, but, instead, pitching it as a state leadership issue, and that is why they are attacking Nitish Kumar and his policies. Every election will have a hundred different issues, but you can’t campaign on all hundred as you would not be able to mobilise the masses that way. So it’s important to choose a handful and focus on those,” Verma said. It is left to be seen if Nitish Kumar joins hands with his one-time partner — the RJD. It’s important to note here that the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) had pulled out of the alliance with the RJD in 2017, citing the ‘no-corruption’ plank. The charges then were against Lalu’s son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar has come to an end after Nitish Kumar pulled out his party, the Janata Dal (United) {JD(U)} from the alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). When asked should there be a BJP chief minister in the northern state now, Bharti said, “I don’t want to get into this.” AIMIM national spokesperson Asim Waqar told PTI that a final decision on who AIMIM could back in case of a hung assembly will be taken by Owaisi, but ruled out supporting the BJP, asserting that his party's fight has always been against the saffron party.Ahead of the polling in the third phase of the polls, the Congress had dubbed the AIMIM as the BJP's 'B-team' and had accused the party of colluding with the BJP. Congress' Bihar unit chief Madan Mohan Jha had said AIMIM will not have any significant impact on the assembly polls as people will not 'waste' their votes. (PTI) Indicating that there is some glitch in vote counting, Plurals Party's Pushpam Priya Chaudhary has claimed that she has not got any votes on the booths where people voted for her in her presence. ""I have 0 votes in those booths where the workers went in front of me and cast their vote!"" she tweeted. In another tweet, he took a swipe at the BJP, saying it has been able to sideline Nitish Kumar with its performance in Bihar. NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said though the trends of Bihar Assembly election results favour the NDA, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav put up a ""gritty"" fight. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself had campaigned for the NDA, he noted. ""The trends so far are in favour of the NDA. I think we did not pay attention to the Bihar election. We (NCP) did not contest because we felt that young leadership in the form of Tejashwi Yadav should come forward,"" Pawar told PTI. On Monday, outside 1 Anney Marg, the official residence of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, there was a pall of silence. Security personnel discouraged anyone from lingering around, and the only vehicles parked in the compound seemed to be those of the police. Sharing a purported list of winning candidates from as many as 119 seats, the RJD claimed returning officers had already congratulated its candidates on their win, but is now refusing to issue certificates, and claiming they have lost. Referring to last year's dramatic turn of events in Maharashtra, which saw the Shiv Sena severing ties with the BJP and forming government with ideological rivals NCP and the Congress, Sena MP Sanjay Raut told PTI that his party had shown what happens ""when word is not kept"" by an alliance partner. ""I heard BJP leaders saying in unison (on TV) that only Nitish babu will be the chief minister. Nitish babu should thank Shiv Sena for that. Not keeping promises will not happen in Bihar because the Shiv Sena has shown in Maharashtra what can happen if word is not kept,"" Raut said. Locked in a tight contest with the NDA, RJD accused Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi of exerting pressure on the District Magistrates to keep RJD's count between 105-110. In a tweet, RJD said it will not allow the 'public mandate to get looted'. ""If elections were held in America with EVMs, could Trump have lost,"" he asked. The man who demanded proof of surgical strikes was confined to history. Sensing the national mood and braving criticism from his fellow Opposition, Kejriwal openly supported abolition of Article 370 and 35A. He opposed the Citizenship Amendment Act in Parliament, but never in public (unlike the Congress). The issue is not to draw a similarity between Bihar and Delhi, and suggest that Kishor could have swung the elections, but to highlight how Kejriwal, with support from Kishor, quickly learnt from the Modi playbook and how the BJP ignored the lessons offered by its own leader. And while his party men, including Amanatullah Khan, supported Jamia and Shaheen Bagh protests, Kejriwal did not. Soon after his deputy Manish Sisodia said ""I stand with Shaheen Bagh"", Kejriwal said protesters should not inconvenience the public and it was the Centre's job to clear that road. Kejriwal kept a laser focus on the positive, highlighting his achievements and putting government machinery and funds towards building his image. It is anybody’s guess what role Kishor, who rose to fame as a strategist for Modi during the 2014 parliamentary polls, played in shaping Kejriwal’s image and campaign. The Delhi BJP leaders not just failed to internalise Modi’s script of ignoring incessant attacks from political rivals and dealing with dissidents from within, but in fact did the reverse. Foreign Secretary assures no Indian will be left behind in conflict-hit Sudan Foreign Secretary assures no Indian will be left behind in conflict-hit Sudan So you know, popular movements don’t want [the Congress to be present]. Either the party stays away, which was the case in anti-CAA protest, or the organisers of the protest keep them out. It tells you the sorry state to which the Congress has fallen. One last thing. One last thing. In my article I quote, as you’ll note, allies of the Congress Party… Shivanand Tiwari of the RJD, saying that the Gandhi family is helping Modi and Shah. Sharad Pawar saying Rahul Gandhi lacks “consistency”, which is a extremely euphemistic way of saying he’s incompetent and doesn’t know what he’s doing. So I think, you know, it’s not out of any issue with a Gandhis per se. It’s our concern for the country I mean, because he can’t confront them…essentially incompetent in solving problems. Look at what we did to our relations with Bangladesh over the CAA. So if an argument could be made, that he is a kind of Indian Deng Xiaoping or an Indian Lee Kuan Yew, who’s authoritarian but competent, knows how to manage the economy, generates growth, provides employment, assures social stability, does not stigmatise minorities, gives women rights… You’re quite right. I mean, removing the Gandhis will not lead to a revival of the Congress automatically. It’s not as if, if you remove the Gandhis today, in the next general election, they will go from 54 to 154. But what removal of the Gandhis will do is to leave a vacuum for a more credible opposition leader – not necessarily from the Congress, not even necessarily from party politics – to emerge as a challenger to Modi. Now, Ram Guha you make a second criticism of the Gandhis. You don’t believe that they put in hard work. And the example you cite in your article is Rahul Gandhi, who in the middle of the Bihar campaign, disappeared to Himachal for a holiday. In your eyes, does Rahul lack dedication and commitment. Does he lack persistence? Karan, why have some excellent leaders of the Congress Party left for the BJP? Because the path to political advancement is blocked by Rahul Gandhi. So, that’s it. This is a manifestation of changes in India. I mean, veneration for royalty, for feudalism, for inherited status is declining. And that’s a sign of the deepening of Indian democracy, which the Gandhis and their followers don’t recognise. You know Karan, it’s not a demand because I’m not a member of the Congress party. But certainly in the interest of their party electorally, they should go. News is just coming in from Kerala, where the UDF is losing ground, including to the BJP. You know, what happened in Telangana, just a few days ago, when they were totally wiped out in a state which they completely controlled a few years ago. Whatever little is left of the republic, we can’t say. And in an article I wrote in The Telegraph rather earlier than other people, how spectacularly unfitted he was. But at least then I was relatively hopeful about India. Now, I cannot be hopeful about India, partly because of the fact that the Gandhis are not going anywhere, but largely because their not going anywhere enables the consolidation, the strengthening and the perpetuation of a regime which will destroy all that this republic was supposed to stand for. I’m going to come back towards the end of this interview, not to the Gandhis but to Congress, because connected with the Gandhis is Congress. And as you said, the reason why you want the Gandhi’s to go to go now and to completely separate themselves from Congress is because otherwise you believe Congress cannot become a viable opposition. In many, many respects. For example, the intimidation of the press that’s going on. The use of UAPA to jail activists. If you criticise the Modi government, Indira Gandhi has been there before and done worse. And Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have still not apologised for the Emergency. Anything Indira Gandhi does is okay by them. ""Conspiracy to scare us through raids won't work. It's a conspiracy to topple our Government. Our proposal for No-Confidence Motion against Speaker should be considered and discussed,"" news agency quoted CPI-ML lawmakers as saying. ""Thus, I will oppose the no-confidence motion and not resign. I will say what I have to say inside the House without any fear or conflict,"" Sinha said. The Bihar BJP has also taken objection to CM Nitish Kumar visiting a temple in Gaya that bars entry of non-Hindus with state minister Mohammed Israil Mansoori and has demanded an apology from Nitish for “hurting sentiments” of people from Hindu religion. Sinha further said that if he resigns, faced with ""baseless charges"", it only hurt his self-respect and also be tantamount to remaining a ""mute spectator to the assault on the parliamentary system"". Vijay Kumar Sinha has on Wednesday resigned from the post of the Bihar Assembly Speaker. ANI Sinha, who is a senior leader of BJP, yesterday said: ""I view the no-confidence motion as springing from a lack of trust, not in me, but the Chair itself. The notice of the motion received at the Vidhan Sabha secretariat has done away with rules, regulations and parliamentary niceties."" He further said that bound by his Chair, he felt it was incumbent upon him to reject such a notice. ""Some baseless and personal allegations have been made in the notice against me. My style of functioning has been called undemocratic and dictatorial,"" he added. Foreign Secretary assures no Indian will be left behind in conflict-hit Sudan The BJP in Bihar hit back at the ‘vendetta politics’ charge, with the state unit chief Sanjay Jaiswal telling ANI, “BJP does not implicate anyone. One-and-a-half years ago, CM Nitish Kumar himself had complained that crores of rupees were caught from Biscomaun. Maybe it (raids) are part of that.” Unsurprisingly, the RJD has slammed the CBI raids and called it vendetta politics by the BJP-led Centre. Singh’s wife could also be heard screaming “my husband is being victimised because of his loyalties. The CBI will get nothing from our place. I will sue the agency for defamation.”"

Tejashwi, who is Grand Alliance's chief ministerial candidate, has promised to provide 10 lakh government jobs in poll-bound Bihar in order to woo the voters across the state. However, the BJP and the JD(U) have constantly attacked the RJD supremo, accusing him of 'misleading' youths. ""Fifteen years ago the poll issue did not use to be development because Bihar was then under Lalu Prasad Jis jungle raj,"" said BJP president JP Nadda on Monday during a poll rally. ""To give jobs to 10 lakh people, even if the salaries of the chief minister, ministers and MLAs need to be cut, then it will be done and jobs will be given,"" Tejashwi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Bihar Assembly Elections 2020: Tejashwi, who is Grand Alliance's chief ministerial candidate, has promised to provide 10 lakh government jobs in poll-bound Bihar in order to woo the voters across the state. The NDA alliance has also blammed the RJD for the ""migration of 25-30 lakh"" people in Bihar, asking Tejashwi to give an explanation over ""misgovernance during the RJDs 15 years rule"". Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar has claimed that Tejashwi's promise is ""impossible"" and claimed that his government has solved the issue of unemployment in Bihar during its rule. ""That is impossible, they won’t get the chance to govern. But for what he (Tejashwi) has said, it will cost the state exchequer Rs 1.44 lakh crore annually,"" Kumar had said earlier. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday tore into the opposition RJD in Bihar, calling its chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav the “yuvraaj” (crown prince) of “jungle raj” and attacking him over the promise of 10 lakh government jobs. Sensing an opportunity to take on the Grand Alliance, the BJP pulled out an old weapon from its Bihar election arsenal. NDA leaders slammed Tejashwi for his comments, and Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi reminded people how RJD’s politics has been about “eliminating Bhu-Ra-Ba-L. “The RJD has made an objectionable remark against forward castes in its rally at Rohtas. The RJD had also opposed the 10 per cent reservation for the upper caste poor… Their politics has been about eliminating Bhu-Ra-Ba-L… They again want to divide Bihar on the basis of caste,” he tweeted. In the ongoing Bihar polls, he attacked the opposition Grand Alliance for allegedly trying to bring ""jungle raj"" in the state once again. Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday accused PM Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of not doing enough for the development of the state. “Bihar doesn’t have adequate jobs, facilities, and its not your fault. This is the fault of your chief minister and prime minister,” said Rahul addressing a rally in Pashchim Champaran. On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tore into the opposition RJD in Bihar, calling its chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav the “yuvraaj” (crown prince) of “jungle raj” and attacking him over the promise of 10 lakh government jobs. Hitting out at the RJD, PM Modi urges people not to vote for those who brought jungle raj in Bihar. ""People of Bihar have taken a resolve to again defeat those who brought 'jungle raj' in the state, those who looted Bihar. These are the people under whose government crime was rampant in the state."" Lok Janshakti Party, headed by Chirag Paswan, is in the fray in 41 seats, which include all the 35 contested by the JD(U), in keeping with the call given by the young party president, who recently pulled out of the NDA in the state, to ""dislodge"" the chief minister from power. Continuing his attack against the prime minister, Rahul said, ""Now Prime Minister doesn't say in speeches that he'll give jobs to 2 crore youth. He knows he was lying & people also know it. I guarantee, if PM comes here & says he'll give 2 crore jobs, crowd will chase him away."" Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Wednesday said there was anger among small shopkeepers, youths, farmers and labourers against Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the national level and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar. Taking a dig at the RJD, PM Modi says, ""The party which is infamous for closing down industries of Bihar, from whom investors maintained distance, is today promising development to the state's people. Let alone govt jobs, if they come to power even private companies will flee from Bihar."" On a day the Election Commission of India shifted out Munger District Magistrate Rajesh Meena and Superintendent of Police Lipi Singh over the October 26 violence in which one person was killed and over three dozen people were injured during a Durga procession, fresh protests broke out in the town on Thursday. The remark in the Assembly by Nitish followed then Leader of Opposition Tejashwi’s charge against him of “plagiarism and payment of a fine of Rs 25,000”. On the BJP questioning him over the job promise, Tejashwi said: “It is healthy for a democracy that people remember poll promises. They will now question the BJP on its endless list of promises… The BJP promised 19 lakh jobs, wasted almost two years of Bihar and did not create a single job,” he said, speaking over the phone from Delhi, where he met senior leaders of RJD allies the first time after the tie-up with the JD(U) was struck, including with Sonia Gandhi. Showing willingness to take charge, Tejashwi did not even put Lalu’s photos prominently in the 2020 campaign material, and went beyond his father’s tested slogans of “social justice” and “secularism”. His main promises were “10 lakh jobs” and “economic justice”. Saying the Mahagathbandhan, an alliance of seven parties that has the JD(U), RJD and Congress, besides other smaller parties, could “offer a template for a national opposition against the BJP”, another top JD(U) leader said, “Bihar has been the factory of political experiments and coalitions. The BJP is now up against a tough Opposition in Bihar. Who knows, there might be a strong Opposition at the national level too?” Nitish, who joined hands with the BJP in 1995, first quit the NDA in 2013, in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, when it became clear that Narendra Modi would be the prime ministerial candidate. Though he didn’t openly pitch himself for the post, he was evidently uneasy about Modi’s growing profile. When he finally parted ways with the BJP in 2013, it was on the ground that the NDA should have a leader with a “clean and secular image”. There’s something about Nitish Kumar and the number 7. As Chief Minister, he has been staying at 7, Circular Road, while using 1, Anne Marg, the official CM residence, as his office. Now, with Nitish severing his five-year-old alliance with the BJP and walking over to the Mahagathbandhan camp, many point out that a famous Delhi address — 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, the official residence of the Prime Minister — could be on his mind. After all, as he left the NDA, Nitish sent out a political dare, couched as prophesy, to the current occupant of 7, Lok Kalyan: “Jo 2014 me aaye the, 2024 me aayenge kya (the one who came to power in 2014, would he also return in 2014)?” JD(U) leaders point to J P Nadda’s statement, made at the BJP’s recent national executive in Hyderabad, where he questioned the future of regional and dynastic parties, to say that Nitish’s fear isn’t misplaced: that any prolonged association with the BJP could end up diminishing the JD(U)’s influence in the state. Barely two years later, in 2017, he snapped ties with the RJD citing his no-corruption plank as the CBI booked RJD leader and now his Deputy CM, Tejashwi Yadav, in the IRCTC case. Nitish’s last stint in the Mahagathbandhan camp was anything but smooth. Only a few months into the arrangement, the stress had started showing, with the JD(U) accusing the RJD of interference. Nitish was no longer the last word in matters of governance, as he had been in the NDA. While the BJP had no strong state leader to match Nitish’s charisma, here in the Mahagathbandhan, he had to share space and spotlight with Lalu and family. The RJD leader’s constant reference to Nitish as “chhote bhai (younger brother)” is also believed to have rankled Nitish. JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh a.k.a. Lalan Singh too defended the party’s decision to return to the RJD despite its strident stand on corruption, saying, “It has been five years since the IRCTC case. There is hardly any movement in it. It is nothing but an act of political vendetta.” As Bihar is under the election season with the political parties making swooping promises of change if voted to power, BJP National President JP Nadda on Saturday took a swipe at RJD leader and Mahagathbandhan's Chief Ministerial face Tejashwi Yadav over his promise of 10 lakh government jobs in the runup to the Bihar Assembly polls. While addressing a public gathering in Sonpur, Nadda said NDA vows to develop the state in a way such that people of Bihar will not be job seekers but offer jobs to others. Cracking down on hate speech, Aligarh police on Saturday, booked Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) student Farhan Zuberi for 'making threats to life and property' in his speech against a French cartoon of Prophet Muhammad. Zuberi, the head of AMU Students' Union was caught on tape giving an open threat to behead 'anyone who disrespects Prophet Mohammad', while protesting against French President Emmanuel Macron. Zuberi- who is also an AIMIM leader- has now been booked under section 506, 153 of the Indian penal code - for criminal intimidation. AIMIM has distanced itself from his comments. Addressing a rally in Jaunpur for upcoming UP by-elections, CM Yogi Adityanath on Saturday, proclaimed that his government will make a law against 'love jihad'. Referring to a recent Allahabad High court order, Adityanath claimed that as the HC had opposed changing religion solely for marriage, his government too will bring a law based on it. This comment comes amid the murder of a 21-year-old woman outside her college in Haryana's Ballabgarh, by her alleged stalker Tausif, after he failed to abduct her - which has termed as 'love jihad' by BJP. As the Supreme Court hears a plea seeking a CBI probe into the Palghar lynching case, the mother of deceased Sadhu Sushil Giri Maharaj once again reiterated her demand for a CBI probe. The Sadhu's mother stated that the police stood there when her son was getting thrashed at the hands of the violent mob, while there were people making videos of the incident. The SC plea seeking a court-monitored or CBI probe into the case has been opposed by the Maharashtra government. Scottish actor and producer Sean Connery has died at the age of 90. Connery was known for his portrayal of James Bond and was also the first one to bring the character to live on the big screen. The cause of death is yet to be ascertained. Sean Connery has been a recipient of the prestigious Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards and three Golden Globes. He had starred in seven James Bond films with the first one being Dr. No. He was honoured with a knighthood in 2000 for his services to film drama. While speaking to the media on Friday, August 12, the National President of the JD(U) said, ""We've said Nitish Kumar is not a PM contender, but he has all qualities needed to become PM. Once new govt starts functioning, we'll go to Delhi & meet Opposition leaders to arrive at consensus to wage a fight against BJP across India."" ""Today, the people of the BJP, who are in power, they are not ready to give respect to allies. The BJP kept disrespecting the JDU time and again,” the JDU leader alleged. JDU's Rajiv Singh also hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and stated that the latter was responsible for breaking the alliance between them. He said, ""This National Democratic Alliance was born out of Atal-Advani Ji’s thoughts. When Atal ji was leading the BJP and when NDA was formed in 1996, we parted in 2013. There was never any difference in NDA even for 17 seconds in 17 years."" Rajiv Singh's statement comes after former Bihar deputy CM and BJP MLA Tarkishore Prasad slammed the Bihar CM for ""dreaming of becoming Prime Minister"". Tarkishore Prasad said, ""Day before yesterday, he (Nitish Kumar) accused BJP of attempting to break the JD(U) and he went quiet on the matter of corruption as if Lalu Prasad Yadav's family's corruption cases are now closed and they have become 'clean'. People know that investigation is still on."" After the political drama that recently unfolded in the state of Bihar, JDU National President Rajiv Ranjan (Lalan) Singh has stated that Nitish Kumar is not a contender for the Prime Minister's seat, however, he has all the qualities needed to become one. Five years after returning to the NDA fold, Nitish Kumar took another U-turn on Tuesday and joined hands with RJD, Congress, and the Left once again. He submitted his resignation to Bihar Governor Phagu Chauhan and staked claim to form the Mahagatbandhan government. Thus, only BJP and the lone AIMIM MLA constitute the opposition space in Bihar now. On August 10, Nitish Kumar and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav were sworn in as the CM and Deputy CM respectively at the Raj Bhawan. This is Nitish Kumar's 8th term as the Chief Minister. ""Whenever he dreams of becoming the Prime Minister, he says things like this because his furious desire inspires him to betray the mandate of the people,"" the BJP leader added.

While bashing the BJP's allegations that 'gundaraj' has returned in Bihar, Rajiv Singh added, ""No Gundaraj has come back in Bihar, no village crime has increased. BJP kept on campaigning for all this. People of Bihar will show them in the 2024 elections whether crime and Goondaraj has increased or if cheaters like BJP will be sent off."" LJP nominees taking on JD (U) candidates have found a way out to indirectly convey its proximity to BJP to voters after the saffron party objected to the use of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s poster or name by any non-NDA political parties. Ahead of Phase-2 polling in Bhagalpur, local channel Voice of Bihar played a clip from a conversation between JD(U) worker Chandan Kumar and sitting party MP Ajay Mandal about the latter “quietly” visiting Bhagalpur’s Pirpainti and campaigning for Independence candidate Aman Paswan. “JD(U) shouldn’t support BJP under any circumstance… We don’t care if the RJD wins,” Mandal says in the clip. The RJD tweeted the clip, saying, “NDA is no political alliance, it’s a conspiracy,” and advised Biharis to not touch this “madhumakkhi ka chhatta (bee-hive)”. Later, Mandal told reporters that the conversation was reported “tod-madod-ke (twisted).” BJP MP Nishikant Dubey told Voice of Bihar, only meeting people matters, “not audio/video, Facebook, Twitter…” The punch line being the impossibility of the promises by ‘Vikas Purush’ Nitish, who has been comparing his “15 years rule versus 15 years misrule” of the Lalu government. Former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey had caused a flutter a month ago with his decision to leave the IPS and join the JD(U) just before the Assembly elections. Although the move did not work out for Pandey, as he did not get a ticket to contest elections, the Election Commission is learnt to have taken note of the development. The poll watchdog may revive its proposal on cooling off period for civil servants keen on joining politics. This proposal was first made by the Commission in 2012, but it did not evoke a positive response from the government then. At that time, the EC wanted a two-year cooling off period. It’s likely that the poll panel may write to the government again on the issue. While Nitish Kumar has been promising irrigation facility in every field, Tejashwi has been talking of a loan waiver to farmers and 10 lakh permanent jobs. Jan Adhikar Party chief Rajesh Ranjan a.k.a Pappu Yadav has been claiming that he would make Bihar one of the top states in Asia, while Rashtriya Lok Samata Party chief Upendra Kushwaha has been talking about overhauling the education system. When the Congress released its manifesto for Bihar elections on Wednesday, the party’s state unit chief, Madan Mohan Jha, was missing. Also absent was CLP leader Sadanand Singh. It turned out that Jha, who is contesting the MLC election from Darbhanga teachers’ constituency, for which voting took place on Thursday, was busy in some last-minute canvassing of votes. Singh’s son Shubhanand Mukesh is the Congress candidate from his seat, Kahalgaon, and he was busy campaigning there. Singh is not contesting this time and the party has fielded his son. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message of caution during the festive season seems to have poured water over the BJP’s grand rally plans in poll-bound Bihar. With the massive crowd in Tejashwi Yadav’s rallies becoming a talking point, the NDA had taken permission for huge rallies in Sasaram, Gaya and Bhagalpur on Friday. However, following the Prime Minister’s message to the nation on Tuesday, reminding people about the need for physical distancing and other Covid-related protocols, the organisers had to issue new guidelines. The crowd strength has now been reduced to 5,000-6,000 and people will not be allowed to stand at the venues. The central BJP, it is learnt, has given strict instructions that large crowds without physical distancing would “annoy” the Prime Minister. Some LJP candidates including its Amarpur (Banka) candidate Mrinal Shekhar have switched to using the slogan “Jhopdi me kamal khilayenge (we want lotus to bloom in hut)”. While hut is the election symbol of LJP, lotus is the symbol of BJP. LJP president Chirag Paswan, who will start campaigning from October 21 onwards, had anyway taken an official stand of “forming a BJP-led LJP” government. Chirag also continues to take digs at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar saying it is the CM who needs the PM’s posters and for LJP, PM is in the heart of every LJP worker. In his election rallies in Bihar, BJP president J P Nadda doesn’t forget to give a personal touch — he reminds the crowd that he was born in Patna, how he had walked through some particular streets, his student days, etc. Nadda’s speeches have one more element in common — the Narendra Modi government’s schemes and programmes in the health sector. While referring to it, he brings in the point that when he was the Union Health minister, Modi had asked him to pay “special attention” to Patna, and that he himself took the initiative in improving health facilities in the state capital. He also doesn’t forget to mention how cooperative CM Nitish Kumar has been in his attempts to build a super-specialty hospital in Patna. Not a single speech misses these points. The former CM led a spirited campaign against the BJP in the run-up to the election, taking on BJP bigwigs like CM Yogi Adityanath, Home Minister Amit Shah and PM Narendra Modi. He is the new entrant in the beleaguered state, who has arrived with populist moves like announcing 2,500 government jobs and regularising 35,000 contractual ones. What has been his masterstroke? He released a personal WhatsApp number for whistleblowers against corruption in the state. With Mayawati’s BSP and the Congress retreating into the shadows in the recent Uttar Pradesh polls, making it a bipolar fight, Akhilesh Yadav has become the state’s strongest Opposition leader. Though they could not wrest power from the BJP, SP and its allies won 125 of 403 seats — up from the SP’s 47 seats in 2017. Exactly a year ago, the nation was battling the brutal second Covid-19 wave amid looming economic distress, vaccine management was a mess, the farm protests were deadlocked, the BJP had come a cropper in West Bengal — all this seems like history. With 183 crore Covid vaccine doses administered to Indians, a Budget betting on a capex push, the BJP’s stunning return in four states, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has galvanised his party and government. Taking the fight to the BJP, Kejriwal has managed to maintain a delicate balance between going all out against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and keeping the focus on “kaam ki rajneeti” — his policies on education, health, water and power and, now, jobs as well. Buch is known for her tough stance on insider trading. For instance, she cracked down on fraudulent tradings by two prominent television anchors of a business news channel. Buch also passed a number of orders banning trading in suspected shell companies based on the list drawn up by the government during their drive against black money in 2017. The handling of the Covid-19 pandemic came under immense criticism during the ferocious second wave. Then came the massive Cabinet reshuffle. The Prime Minister’s surprise pick during the crisis time was the junior minister for Chemical and Fertilisers, Mansukh Mandaviya. Having realised early on that the traditional Muslim-Yadav combination alone can’t get him power in the state, he’s working to make RJD more assimilative. His 2020 Assembly polls promise of 10 lakh jobs made him popular among the youth. In the Assembly, he has made a mark with strongly argued speeches. Earlier this year, he crafted his political relevance by embarking on a 100-km “Walk for Water” yatra, demanding a check dam project on the river Cauvery. He is positioning himself as a prominent Vokkaliga leader in south Karnataka at a time when the JD (S) is losing its hold. In a recent meeting of the RSS’s Akhil Bhartiya Pratinidhi Sabha in Ahmedabad, Bhagwat reportedly said that when the BJP is in power, it creates anukoolta (compatibility) which causes shithilta (laxity) and cautioned cadres against any possible asavdhani (inattention). With more polls coming up, that’s a timely reminder. Senior RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Monday alleged that the 'double- engine' governments run by the BJP at the Centre and in Assam are 'useless' as they indulged in corruption spread hatred among people. Addressing his first election rally in Assam at Tinsukia, the former deputy chief minister of Bihar claimed that the saffron party practises the politics of hate. ""Inflation is at its peak. BJP governments are there in Assam and at the Centre. That means it is a double-engine government. But it is useless. Everywhere corruption is taking place and they are creating enmity between brothers. Politics of hate is happening,"" he said. --PTI Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday attacked the Narendra Modi government over the fuel price hike and its economic policies, accusing it of taking money from the pockets of people instead of putting it in their hand, as launched his second leg of campaign for the April 6 assembly elections in Kerala.

The BJP has made it one of its main weapons against the Mamata Banerjee government, saying that, if it comes to power, it will build a “Sonar Bangla”, ending “Syndicate Raj” and “Cut Money” culture.

Until March 14, 56-year-old Lathika, who headed the Mahila Congress in Kerala, had short salt-and-pepper hair, quite like the late Indira Gandhi. That day, as it became evident that the Congress was not going to give her the ticket for her home constituency of Ettumanoor, Lathika resigned from party posts and proceeded to tonsure her head in front of the Congress office in Thiruvanantha- puram, while raising slogans in favour of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. Her protest was against the state leadership, she said, and the poor representation of women — 10 out of 92 — in the Congress list.

The Union Budget 2021-22 reflects the Centre's “persistent efforts to sideline” non-BJP ruled states, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh Monday said. His Cabinet colleague and state Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal on claimed that the “entire north India” was ignored in the Budget, which was also silent on agricultural unrest, unemployment and problems of the middle class. It also accused the Centre of ignoring Maharashtra which, it said, contributes highest revenue to the Union government's coffers. Finance Minister Sitharaman presented the 2021-22 Union Budget on Monday. '...what is unfortunate is that the (central) government has set a new trend of playing dirty politics of votes through budget,' the editorial said.

He also alleged that Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has failed to deliver and people have started realising it. Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said the budget has left the middle class ""bruised and wounded"" by not changing tax slabs, not increasing deductions, not making new deduction slots like home loans, not bringing fuel under GST, not sharing Rs 19 Lakh crore gain from fuel taxes, not reducing GST rates. ""After promising a century, FM is out hit wicket at Zero !! Instead of calling it as 'budget of the century' it will be remembered as 'blunder of the century' by BJP Govt #Budget2021,"" he tweeted. Leaders of major political parties in Kerala, except the BJP, denounced the union budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman Monday, saying it has no major proposals to solve the recession in the economy post-pandemic or to put money in the hands of the people. Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee chief Kumari Selja Monday said that Union Budget had dashed the hopes of people of Haryana, adding that the state had been ignored by the central government. “The Budget is reflective of the BJP-led central government's total apathy towards the common man, the middle class and farmers. It also manifests the central government's persistent efforts to sideline non-BJP states like ours, as well as its anti-federal mindset,” said Amarinder, pointing to the gap between the fiscal deficit targets fixed for the Union government and states."

He won after defeating Ravindra Ray of the Hindustani Awam Morcha. According to media reports, Tej Pratap chose to contest from the Hasanpur seat instead of Mahua owing to rumours of estranged wife Aishwarya Rai contesting from Mahua.

There are broadly five takeaways from this election, no matter which way it eventually goes when the vote count is over. New Delhi: Vote count was on in Bihar Tuesday evening, 12 hours after it started, with a tantalising see-saw battle between the Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Tejashwi Yadav-led opposition alliance.

Addressing a press conference late Tuesday, party chief and Hyderabad MP Owaisi thanked the people of the Seemanchal region for electing five AIMIM candidates. Also read: CPI(ML) Liberation, CPI(M), CPI make mark in Bihar elections, take lead in 18 of 29 seats In fact, of the 20 seats the AIMIM contested, the Mahagathbandhan won on eight — Sherghati, Sahebpur Kamal, Phulwari, Kishanganj, Kasba, Manihari, Araria, Thakurganj — while an independent candidate is leading in Sikta. In all these seats, the AIMIM failed to “dent” the Mahagathbandhan’s vote share. Also read: Tejashwi’s arrival, Nitish’s tenacity, Shah’s masterstroke — 5 takeaways from Bihar results The JD(U)’s move was all the more surprising because CM Nitish Kumar has himself had very little tolerance for tainted names. In 2005, when he took oath as CM, Jitan Ram Manjhi was sworn in as a minister, but dropped from the ministry the same day. Manjhi, who had been with the RJD till the year before, had a case pending against him, popularly known as the B.Ed. scam, which had taken place under Rabri Devi’s government. Also read: Tejashwi’s arrival, Nitish’s tenacity, Shah’s masterstroke — 5 takeaways from Bihar results “I got only 10 days to prepare post my father’s death. Happy that Bihar gave love to the LJP and around 25 lakh voters trusted ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’. We secured 6% votes while contesting alone. We were called a ‘pichhlaggu‘ (hanger on) party that can do something only with other’s support. We showed courage,” he said. Also read: Tejashwi’s arrival, Nitish’s tenacity, Shah’s masterstroke — 5 takeaways from Bihar results When Nitish came to power in 2005, retired police officers recall, he held a meeting of senior officers and told them, “I have been voted to power by the people on the promise that I will end ‘Jungle Raj’. It’s for you to deliver and I am willing to give you resources and new laws.” “Also, in 2005, Nitish had the support of most of the police officers. Today, the police force is split as those belonging to a particular caste get plum posts and the CM also has blue-eyed boys,” he added. Compare the number of such incidents in 2004, the last year of Lalu-Rabri regime, and the first ten months of 2020 for which police data is available — 2,649 murders in 2020 (January-October) as against 3,861 in 2004; 1,244 rapes in 2020 (January-October) as against 1,063 in 2004; 6,500 kidnappings in 2020 (January-October) as compared to 2,566 in 2004. There is a catch in these numbers, though. After his fifth review meeting Wednesday, Nitish Kumar told reporters he is keeping a close watch on the law and order situation. “CM Nitish Kumar will outclass many police officers when it comes to discussions on controlling law and order. But the bottom line is that it is not the CM who controls crime. It is the DGP. In 2005, there were DGPs who took responsibility and initiative in controlling crime. Therefore, new ways to control crime began. But in the past few years, DGPs have tended to remain behind the CM,” he said."

At a mega rally in Midnapore district, Shah welcomed Adhikari into the saffron party and took a swipe at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Shri @AmitShah addresses a public meeting in Midnapore, West Bengal. #AmitShahInBengal https://t.co/VHQh21XG33 In an open letter addressed to the grassroots members of the Trinamool Congress, Adhikari wrote that West Bengal is standing at a critical juncture ahead of the elections. He said “an extremely deep rot and malaise” has set in his former party led by Banerjee. BJP’s West Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya, Vice President Mukul Roy and the party’s state unit chief Dilip Ghosh were also present at the rally. Along with Adhikari, who represents the Nandigram Assembly seat, the other MLAs who switched sides are Banasri Maity, Silbhdrada Dutta, Biswajit Kundu, Sukra Munda, Dipali Biswas and Saikat Panja. Adhikari, addressing the rally, said he was joining the BJP to work as an ordinary worker. “The economic condition of West Bengal is in a very bad state,” he said. “If the state has to be salvaged, its reins need to be handed over to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” He also claimed that the chief minister was busy trying to ensure that her nephew Abhishek Banerjee takes her post next. Shah, who is on a two-day visit to West Bengal, declared that the BJP will win more than 200 seats in the 2021 Assembly elections. West Bengal has a 294-member Assembly. Adhikari, a two-term MP, had been in charge of the TMC in several districts, including Malda, Murshidabad, Purulia and Bankura. The 49-year-old-leader has a crucial support base in the state. He was also the face of the Trinamool Congress in the 2008 Nandigram movement, which by many accounts, was a major factor in the unseating of the Left Front government in the state in 2011. Addressing the rally, Shah said the tsunami of defections, which he was witnessing in West Bengal, would leave Banerjee alone by the time elections are held in the state next year. “Why are so many people leaving Trinamool Congress,” he asked. “Because of the misrule, corruption and nepotism of Mamata Banerjee. Didi, this is just the beginning. By the time elections come, you will be left all alone.” Kolkata: As the assembly elections in West Bengal are coming closer, the political temperature in the state is also rising. After political rhetoric, the process of counter-attack through election rallies is going to start. In this episode, Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and CM Mamta Banerjee are going to hold a big rally in Western Medinipur (Midnapore). This rally of CM Banerjee is to be held in the same ground where PM Modi's rally was held in the year 2018. Through this rally, TMC wants to show its strength to the BJP along with delivering a message to the rebel leaders within the party. If TMC is to be believed, this rally will be attended by about 2 lakh people. The last few days many leaders from Mamta Banerjee's party have rebelled and joined BJP. Recently, TMC's elder leader Suvendu Adhikari has also resigned from the post of minister. However, it has also been claimed to convince him later. Suvendu has dominance in East and West Medinipur, where Mamta Banerjee's rally is going to take place. In such a situation, Mamta's rally will send a message to the party's people along with the opposition. Political drama started again in Rajasthan, Congress accuses Amit Shah of buying MLAs The preparations for the rally are in their final stages.

He was also behind a campaign to boycott Bollywood star Deepika Padukone’s movies after she visited the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus following a mob attack there in January 2020. Bagga also made allegedly derogatory tweets — which he later deleted — as he targeted Kejriwal over his comments on the film. The remarks earned him an FIR, but he remained unapologetic. “This is not an arrest but a kidnapping. This is not a good precedent. They are using the police to score political points. Not only Bagga, Punjab Police had earlier booked the Delhi BJP’s Naveen Kumar, too. Imagine if the Delhi Police had been under Arvind Kejriwal,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana. Last month, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sunny Ahluwalia filed a complaint against Bagga for allegedly making incendiary social media posts, including a “threat” against party chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. The case was lodged at the cyber cell in Mohali (Punjab) under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), 505-2 (statements creating or promoting enmity) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Bagga and his group have defaced walls around the Pakistan High Commission and put up posters demanding independence for Balochistan. They’ve pasted other controversial posters, too, including one calling former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi “the father of mob lynching.” Bagga’s outfit also took credit for heckling the late Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani in 2012 at an event organised by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi. Bagga was made a spokesperson for the Delhi BJP in 2017 and was given a party ticket to contest the 2020 Delhi assembly polls from Hari Nagar, but lost. He had expressed a desire to contest from Tilak Nagar, but after Rajiv Babbar was fielded from that constituency, he was asked to settle for Hari Nagar. Bagga was also involved in the BJP’s 2021 West Bengal assembly election campaign, as well as the Uttarakhand assembly polls earlier this year. During the latter he sparked a row by posting a morphed photo of Congress leader and former CM Harish Rawat, edited to make him look like Aligarh Muslim University founder Syed Ahmad Khan — amid a controversy over Rawat allegedly promising to start a Muslim university in the state.

He is also no longer part of the state unit’s two WhatsApp groups. According to sources, Bagga was removed from two WhatsApp groups, one meant for the party spokespersons, on 19 June. “No reason was given by the state unit for removing him from the two WhatsApp groups. On 22 June, they added him once again. But then he left both the groups on his own,” said a Delhi BJP functionary. Bagga had not participated in the Delhi BJP’s Twitter campaign to highlight how it had distributed relief material. “But Bagga was quite clear that he did not wish to highlight distribution of ‘chips’ as many were already mocking the state unit for it,” said the functionary. The sources said Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana had also left the group 20 days back on his own as he was upset about the state unit not delivering on the promises made to him. “Khurana was also upset with the functioning of the media unit of the Delhi BJP,” said a leader. Bagga is not alone. Harish Khurana, former chief minister Madan Lal Khurana’s son who is also a spokesperson, also left the WhatsApp group of Delhi BJP around 20 days ago. According to sources, he was unhappy over the functioning of the media unit. The sources said Bagga did not want to tweet about the party distributing “chips” as relief material. Bagga is, however, not the only party functionary who was removed from the WhatsApp groups. Earlier, another spokesperson Neha Shalini Dua was removed but she was added later.

The protest took place on the Toli Chowki main road in the afternoon, which comes under the Golconda police station limits in Hyderabad’s west zone. Even though the police arrived quickly on the scene, it was initially unable to contain the protestors from working, who finally settled in an area after which the police addressed them. On Sunday, about 1,000 migrant workers, mostly from northern India, took to the streets in protest at Toli Chowki in Hyderabad. The protestors were demanding that they be sent back home, as they were not able to earn money and were facing difficulties to survive in the city due to the ongoing lockdown imposed in the state to contain the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. “I am unable to explain it [the loss of officers] in words. It was a very emotional moment as the vans carrying the mortal remains passed through my town after watching photos and videos of the crash in media,” said K.K.

De in the piece titled ""Talk Time: What went wrong with Gunjan Saxena"" critiques the misrepresentation of the Armed Forces and misleadingly states that the film depicted Saxena as a recipient of the Shaurya Chakra. BOOM reached out to Shobhaa De who said that she did not recall watching the end credits of the film to ascertain that Gunjan Saxena was portrayed as a recipient of the Shaurya Chakra award. Additionally, news outlets including The Indian Express, India Today and ScoopWhoop also erroneously claimed that Saxena received the Shaurya Chakra award after the Kargil War. The articles however does not state that the biopic of Saxena represented her as a Shaurya Chakra awardee. She claims that her reference to the award was based on an interview by Wing Commander (retd) Namrata Chandi. De told BOOM via message, ""I went by what her colleagues stated. I do not recall if this was shown in the end credits of the film. But it was mentioned in an interview by Namrata Chandi, the other lady pilot and repeatedly stressed by the other Wing Commander in her widely circulated post (Flight Lieutenant retd Sreevidya Rajan)."" Further, BOOM found an interview of Wing Commander (retd) Namrita Chandi, to Dainik Bhaskar. The article quotes Chandi as saying, ""I am amazed that this film has shown Gunjan Saxena received the Shaurya Chakra. This is entirely wrong. These are facts which even Gunjan have rubbished. Showing these, the film's makers have belittled the achievements and bravery of the real Shaurya Chakra awardees.""

Also, Saxena in a blog authored in NDTV stated that ""Neither I nor the filmmakers ever claimed I was a ""Shaurya Chakra"" awardee."" An excerpt from the blog reads, ""After Kargil, I received the ""Shaurya Veer"" award from a civilian organisation in Uttar Pradesh. A certain section of the internet news possibly turned ""Veer"" into ""Chakra"". This has been clarified many times during my media interactions for the movie's promotions. Is it fair to blame me for this?"" An excerpt from the opinion piece by De reads, ""And most importantly, it has been pointed out that Saxena did not receive the Shaurya Chakra, as shown in the film. This is a serious error."" Below is the screenshot of the same. Janhvi Kapoor in a still from Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl (courtesy janhvikapoor) Neither I nor the filmmakers ever claimed I was a ""Shaurya Chakra"" awardee. After Kargil, I received the ""Shaurya Veer"" award from a civilian organisation in Uttar Pradesh. A certain section of the internet news possibly turned ""Veer"" into ""Chakra"". This has been clarified many times during my media interactions for the movie's promotions. Is it fair to blame me for this? Those were my credentials, my achievements. That is my hard-earned trophy and I will never let anybody with vested interests point a finger at it. One article by a so-called expert on my affairs has even claimed that I was not the first woman pilot in the Kargil war. Now, for all of you reading this absurd propaganda and ranting over the ""peddling of lies"", there is a humble submission. The author, claiming to protect the image of the IAF for whatever vested interests or hidden agenda, is questioning the very authenticity of the Air Force's stand in 1999 after the Kargil war. I did hear one senior journalist pointing out threadbare factual inaccuracies in the movie. Yes, I do agree and I know the sequence of events in the Kargil war. I have never denied it or claimed otherwise. Why would anyone? It is creative license, which is certainly not with me but with the makers of the movie. But the intention of the movie was to inspire people to chase their dreams with hope and positivity, the way I chased mine. The entire storyline was based on the theme of my journey, how my dreams became reality. As I understand, the film was never intended to be a documentary on the Kargil war. The idea was to showcase my life, my journey, my dreams and my little achievements. Neither I nor Sharan Sharma (the director) intended to insult the IAF. I can say this with conviction. In fact, where I was regularly consulted on the phone or in person (I was present during four or five shoots in Lucknow) was on the authenticity of the uniforms, my mannerisms, the layout of offices and technical terms or jargon linked to flying. In the film Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl, the ‘reel hero’, on direction of the filmmakers, tarnishes the image of the Indian Air Force through inappropriate portrayal of the IAF’s work culture, which according to them is against women. Also read: Gunjan Saxena’s IAF coursemate Sreevidya Rajan shocked by filmmakers’ ‘twisting of facts’ The movie was to showcase the courage and bravery of a woman helicopter pilot. However, it highlights nonissues such as lack of facilities and discrimination against women without factual evidence to support the portrayal. Johar’s ignorance is also highlighted by the fact that during the announcement of the film, he had mentioned Gunjan as a Shaurya Chakra awardee. I am a Shaurya Chakra recipient myself, but I was not aware about Gunjan. So I tried finding out which year she was awarded the Shaurya Chakra to congratulate her. I haven’t been able to find any evidence of the same. AVM Suryakant Chafekar, AVSM ,Shaurya Chakra retired as SAASO maintenance command the Commanding Officer of the 48 Squadron and retired from the Indian Air Force in 2017. Views are personal. In 1994, I was a flying instructor at Transport Training base at Yelahanka, Bengaluru when the first batch of women pilots were inducted in the transport stream. At Yelahanka, separate facilities were provided to them as the infrastructure required was built in shortest possible time. The first pilot course for women on helicopter was conducted much later. By then, the IAF had gained enough experience in conducting courses for women. Hence, the depiction in the Janhvi Kapoor starrer movie that facilities were not available is a lie and has been added to create sensation. I would have laughed about this but for its implication and effect on impressionable young women of India who may generalize this.On the other hand this is simply Karan Johar ‘Air Force’ version of Student of the Year. ""After Kargil, I received the ""Shaurya Veer"" award from a civilian organisation in Uttar Pradesh. A certain section of the internet news possibly turned ""Veer"" into ""Chakra"". This has been clarified many times during my media interactions for the movie's promotions. Is it fair to blame me for this?"" she questioned. She is married to Wing Commander Gautam Narain, an Indian Air Force pilot and instructor at the National Defence Academy. Responding to an opinion piece which questioned the factual accuracy of her biopic, the former IAF pilot agreed that although changes were made to the sequence of the Kargil war, it was only because of the ""creative license"" that the makers of the movie hold. ""One article by a so-called expert on my affairs has even claimed that I was not the first woman pilot in the Kargil war. Now, for all of you reading this absurd propaganda and ranting over the ""peddling of lies"", there is a humble submission. The author, claiming to protect the image of the IAF for whatever vested interests or hidden agenda, is questioning the very authenticity of the Air Force's stand in 1999 after the Kargil war."" 🚫An earlier version said Gunjan Saxena was awarded the Shaurya Chakra. This is wrong and the line has been removed. 🚫 “The machine will not know whether a man is flying it or a woman is flying it.” This is what Gunjan Saxena, the first Indian Air Force woman pilot who served in the 1999 Kargil conflict, and who had a biopic made on her for breaking the glass ceiling, has to say about flying an aircraft. On her life story making it to the silver screen, Gunjan said she did not understand why someone wanted to shoot a biopic on her life. “I wasn’t really convinced as to why someone would want to do a movie on my life. You have lived your life so you don’t find it exciting. It’s exciting only when someone else looks at it,” she said. Born in Lucknow in 1975, Gunjan arrived in Delhi to study Physics from Hansraj College. After pursuing her graduation, Gunjan joined the Delhi Flying Club at Safdarjung for aviation training and in 1994, joined the Indian Air Force along with 24 other women–the first batch of women for training in the IAF. SEE ALSO: ‘Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl’: Rekha Bharadwaj’s Voice And Amit Trivedi’s Music Are The Stars Of The Song ‘Dori Tutti Gaiyaan’ Gunjan Saxena biopic is inspirational, not preachy. And that really is how Sharan Sharma has decided to delve in and tell the extraordinary story in his directorial venture. Of course, the title/trailer promises the brave and bold face of the ‘Kargil Girl’, but the story is about the course Gunjan Saxena’s life took until she found herself in the combat zone, in the line of fire. It is very much about her relationship with her father, Lt Col (retired) Anup Saxena and how he propels her to wing out. Of course, the movie traces all her milestones where she broke glass ceilings and pushed the envelope for women but it shows nationalism in the right light without the chest-thumping and prevalent jingoism. Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl is based on the life and works of Gunjan Saxena who was the first female combat aviator to go to war, amongst many other things. The biopic is inspired by her journey to become the 1999 Kargil War veteran and the first woman Shaurya Chakra awardee, with creative liberties of course. Janhvi Kapoor who made her debut with Dharma productions’ Dhadak, got back in the hood to deliver her personal best and as IAF officer flying cheetah helicopters, no less! The actress looked the part and actually flew helicopters to do so. One could say that the responsibility to depict the life of a real-life shero has added the much-needed nuance to her acting skills. But is it worth the watch? Find out in the review below!

The error is regretted. You can read The Quint’s fact check here: Gunjan Saxena Isn’t a Shaurya Chakra Awardee, Nor Did She Claim So) The film is based on the real-life story of Gunjan Saxena, India’s first female Air Force Officer to fly in a combat zone during the 1999 Kargil War. Along with Flight Lieutenant Srividya Rajan, she was tasked with casualty evacuation during the war. The story by itself is in no want of bravado or inspiration. The challenge, therefore, was always going to be how this cinematic re-telling will pan out. Added to that was the risk of over dramatisation. Helmed by Sharan Sharma, who has written and adorned this story along with Nikhil Mehrotra, this incredible feat gets the taut and stirring treatment it deserves. The movie is directed by Sharan Sharma and Jahnvi Kapoor will act in the lead role of Gunjan Saxena. Pankaj Tripathi has played the role of Gunjan’s father in the movie. Gunjan husband is a Wing Commander in Indian Air Force. The couple has a daughter named Pragya and currently, they reside in Jamnagar, a city of Gujarat. Let’s look into some of the interesting facts about Flight Lieutenant Gunjan Saxena! Gunjan Saxena is a renowned name as she is the first woman Indian Air Force officer. She with her counterpart Flight Lieutenant Srividya Rajan helped turn things in India’s favour in the Kargil War. That was also the first batch of women air force trainees for the IAF. It was then Gunjan met her counterpart, Srividya Rajan who also go on to fly a Cheetah in Kargil War Zone."

Times Now fell for a fake account impersonating Asha Ranaut - Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut's mother - on Wednesday and falsely claimed that the former had lashed out against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in a tweet. The article was based on a tweet by the fake account which claims to be the actor's mother. BOOM found that the fake handle @RealAshaRanaut was earlier impersonating Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat. Times Now recently fell for another fake account impersonating late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's sister. The fake handle has only 20 tweets, all in Hindi, which take a dig at Uddhav Thackeray, Shiv Sena, BMC and asks its followers to retweet if they agree. ""Taking to Twitter, Asha Ranaut said: ""Uddhav Thackeray, today you did not crush my daughter Kangana's office but the soul of late Bala Saheb ji Thackeray,"" the article further said. We than ran a search on Twitter using the string (to:DrMohanRss1) to find replies to the account @DrMohanRss1 and found a reply which reported the handle. The account deleted its previous tweets before impersonating Asha Ranaut around September 7, 2020. The woman dancing with Singh is not his niece but Punjabi choreographer Manpreet Toor. “We can’t believe all the news we read in the newspaper,” she wrote sharing the same video on August 18. The tweets were made by an account with the username @K_KSingh_. This is an imposter account with an earlier username @Real_Aishwarya_. Last year in September, a story on former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan’s alleged response to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal’s gaffe where he attributed the discovery of gravity to Albert Einstein splashed across media outlets. “It’s a sign that you’re hiding real data: Rajan on Goyal faux pas,” was the republished IANS story. 2.

In fact, Modiji loves me like a son.” In 2018, news agency IANS reported that this tweet was made by Tripura Chief Minister, Biplab Deb. The story was taken down after IANS realised that the tweet was by a parody account of Deb. 3. IANS falls for satire on Pakistani PM Imran Khan reading COVID-19 chart upside down Aaj Tak aired alleged tweets of Rajput’s father K K Singh and claimed that he is demanding a CBI probe into his son’s death.

If something happens to me tomorrow, how many people are with me?) The relevant section can be watched 2:20 minutes onward where Aaj Tak also said that the account could not be verified. The above case wasn’t the only instance when IANS published news based on fake accounts or satirical posts and other news organisations amplifyed the misinformation. Alt News had earlier published a report which revealed that this account was impersonating Sonu Nigam to target actor Shahrukh Khan. Our detailed fact-check can be read here. Turns out, the report was based on a parody account of Raghuram Rajan. This was based on a satirical post by website The Dependent. It must be noted that this is not the first time that the media a cited fake social media handle while reporting on the Sushant Singh Rajput case. Previously, Aaj Tak showed tweets claiming to be by the late actor’s father in a report, when in fact, these tweets were fake. It also used tweets from a fake account impersonating Rajput as part of its story on the actor’s final tweets. Recently, Times Now also ran a tweet posted by a fake account posing as Rajput’s sister as ‘breaking news’. Apart from this, a number of media outlets also misidentified Rajput’s choreographer as his niece in their stories on a video of the two dancing together. The Twitter handle that media organisations were claiming belonged to Rhea Chakraborty’s father Indrajit Chakraborty is actually a fake one, which had the username @WeWantRahul only a few days ago. The user running this account posted a tweet following the arrest of the actress in which they wrote, “Please trend for my daughter. #JusticeFor Rhea. Please INDIA, help.” This tweet received thousands of likes and retweets. After this, the user made a slew of tweets related to this matter. These were then picked up by news channels and falsely circulated as the real Indrajit Chakraborty’s social media activity. Interestingly, The Times of India first published an erroneous report and later turned it into a fact-check report without any explanation. We should also point out that ABP News has also removed all the tweets while tweaking some information in its English article. Its report has now described this Twitter handle as unverified, but they have not issued any explanation for these edits. At the same time, the Hindi website of the channel has instead presented their old article as a fact-check report. This becomes clear once you look at the URL of the piece. (archived link to the old article by ABP News) The link to the tweet seen in the screenshot above is https://twitter.com/WeWantRahuI/status/1267501722055786499. If you copy-paste the link, you will find it redirects to the handle created in the name of Indrajit Chakraborty. This is possible only when a Twitter user changes their username. This has been explained in the video below. To sum it up, a Twitter user had changed their username to Indrajit Chakraborty, the father of actor Rhea Chakraborty. After changing their username and display name, this account began tweeting in support of Rhea. Various news channels believed that these tweets were actually made by Rhea’s father. We looked through the previous iterations of the @WeWantRahul Twitter handle on Wayback Machine. This is a web archive portal that automatically takes snapshots of web pages at different points of time. Upon looking through the archived links of this handle, we found that it used to be a Rahul Gandhi fan account at one point, with a display name that read, ‘Rahul Gandhi as next PM of INDIA’. When we looked at some of the older tweets that had been posted by this account, we found that it had changed its Twitter username to @IndrajitChakra and display name (which appears above the username), to ‘Indrajit Chakraborty’ on September 6. Also on this day, the user had posted some tweets with #StandwithRheaChakraborty and #IamWithRhea hashtags. The username @WeWantRahul can actually be seen in another user’s reply to a tweet posted by the account from the same day too. India TV also reported that the Twitter handle belonged to Chakraborty’s father. It has now amended its article and added ‘CORRECTION’ to the title, while also apologizing for the error. Hindustan Times also issued a clarification on this matter, later withdrawing its report. On September 9, The Times of India reported that actor Rhea Chakraborty’s father Indrajit Chakraborty was deeply saddened by the news of her arrest. According to the report, her father also issued a tweet which said, “No father can bear injustice on his daughter. I should die.” Its online entertainment platform ETimes also featured these tweets in a video story on the actor’s arrest. On August 10 Tiwari tweeted in Hindi, “Since yesterday, certain news is circulating. It is totally false, misleading, and a rumour. Kindly pay no attention to it. (कुछ खबरें कल से प्रसारित हो रहीं हैं। वो पूर्णतः गलत, भ्रामक और अफवाह हैं। कृपया उन पर ध्यान ना दें।). Thus, social media claims that Panta SP Vinay Tiwari, who is investigating Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, was deputed by CBI is false. Around August 9, several social media users tweeted that Tiwari was deputed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after his “forced quarantine” by the BMC. Twitter user @rvaidya2000 tweeted, “Master Stroke by Amit Shah..! Vinay Tiwari sent to CBI on deputation. Yes, that Bihar SP who was by force quarantined by Thackrey’s BMC.:)) RT.” This tweet gained around 3,000 tweets. (archive) Alt News spoke with Tiwari who refuted social media claims regarding his appointment by the CBI. “I am aware that several social media accounts have posted this rumour. I categorically refute these claims,” he said. Similarly, several other Twitter users posted the same claim including — Gaurav Pradhan, editor-in-chief of Gulf Connoisseur Meena Das Narayan, @Shilpi_Flyhigh, @arnab5222, @ThePushpendra_, and @vibhor_anand. Master Stroke by Amit Shah..!😳 Vinay Tiwari sent to CBI on deputation. Yes, that Bihar SP who was by force quarantined by Thackrey’s BMC.:)) RT Wire agency IANS fell for tweets from a fake Twitter account impersonating Sara Pilot, wife of Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, criticising Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot amid the ongoing political crisis in the state. A glance at the account gives clues that it is not Sara Pilot's account, the first major clue is that her name is spelt wrong as 'Sarah', and the Twitter bio is riddled with obvious spelling mistakes that would not have been there on an official account. The fake account was earlier called out by The Quint. Tabeenah Anjum, a journalist from Rajasthan had tweeted calling out media outlets for using tweets from the fake account. ""Please don't use tweets from here to file stories. This is a FAKE twitter account. Surprised to see tweets from this account making it to mainstream news and agency stories,"" she said in her tweet on July 12, 2020.

Even IANS also got the name of Sara Pilot wrong in its article as 'Sarah'. This recent IANS article , which was republished by several news outlets, referred to a series of tweets by the impostor account of Sara Pilot attacking Gehlot. Sachin Pilot is reported to have revolted against the Gehlot led Congress government in the state which has led to the political crisis. The IANS report was carried by media outlets like Outlook and Free Press Journal, and English Jagran which quoted tweets by the fake account like a tweet taking a jibe at Gehlot saying, ""big magicians started sweating when we go to Delhi"" and another tweet with an old video of Sachin Pilot walking with hundreds of supporters when the government was out of power. Additionally, the fake account is not followed by Sachin Pilot or Omar Abdullah and we did not find any verified account of Sara Pilot on the platform. Using the Twitter analytics tool doesfollow, we were able to determine that neither follows the imposter account which would have not been the case if it was an official account. ""Amid political crisis in Rajasthan, Sarah Pilot, wife of Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, on Sunday, attacked Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot without taking his name.

""The people assaulting the manager alleging delay in crop loan to farmers in the viral video are from Youth Congress including Congress taluka head Bandhu Chowdhary,"" said Smita Masaye, Assistant Police Inspector (API).

The police further added that the incident happened at an IDBI bank branch in Malkapur. On searching with Marathi keywords like 'bank', 'idbi', 'Maharashtra', we found local media reports which stated that the incident happened in Malkapur, Buldhana district. According to news reports, an IDBI Bank manager was assaulted by Youth Congress workers alleging delay in crop loan-related work for farmers. Bank Manager Devidas Ghate at the Malkapur IDBI Bank branch in Buldhana district was assaulted by Youth Congress workers including Youth Congress taluka head Sambhaji Shirke and Congress taluka head Bandhu Chowdhary reported 7 Star News on September 10, 2020.

Mr. Samant is a key Sena leader from the Konkan region. - Shoumojit Banerjee, Mumbai Bureau State minister Aaditya Thackeray, son of Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, and Sena chief spokesman Sanjay Raut addressed party cadres in suburban Dahisar to drum up support for the beleaguered party leadership and slammed the Shinde camp. The rebel faction challenged the appointment of Sena MLA from Mumbai Ajay Choudhari as the Legislature Party leader, and the rejection of their no-confidence motion against Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal. Slamming the dissident Shiv Sena MLAs for having “monstrous ambitions”, Maharashtra Minister Aaditya Thackeray says even if all the party legislators turn rebels, victory will always be of the party. The national executive barred any individual or group from using the name of the party’s founder, the late Bal Thackeray, after reports that the rebel MLAs would name their group as Shiv Sena (Balasaheb Thackeray). “Time is running out. This government will last for two to three days. The BJP has nothing to do with this rebellion. Shiv Sena rebels have resentment towards Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray as development funds were diverted by NCP and Congress,” the Union Minister of State for Railway, Coal and Mines says Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on June 26 posted a tweet targetting the rebel MLAs of the party, in which he said that however long they may “hide” in Assam’s Guwahati, they will ultimately have to come to “chowpatty”, a reference to Mumbai. Queried on the possibility of the Eknath Shinde-led group merging with the BJP, Mr. Danve, himself a former state unit chief, says there was no such proposal and if one comes then the senior leadership would take a call. - PTI Mr. Khan terms the rebel MLAs “crooks who left in fear of raids” by the Enforcement Directorate, the Income Tax Department and the Central Bureau of Investigation. “There is no place for cowards in the party,” he says. Sending out a warning to Mr. Shinde, he says the BJP only believes in playing divisive politics. “They believe in dividing and ruling. If the Sena does not believe in upholding its Hindutva principles, then why did Uddhav ji change Aurangabad’s name to Sambhajinagar, after a great Maratha warrior? Aaditya ji just returned from Ayodhya after visiting the Ram temple. Why would he do that if the Sena did not believe in practising Hindutva? I stand by Uddhav ji and applaud his decision to step down as Chief Minister,” he says. Kiran Tawade, a party worker from Lalbaug, says, “Just because Mr. Thackeray is soft-spoken, focuses on social welfare and good governance, and does not target burqa-clad women and men wearing skullcaps, it does not mean that he is following ‘soft Hindutva’.” She adds that his approach to Hindutva is pure and he is fully committed to it. “All those MLAs who have left our party were scared of the raids and summons by the Central probe agencies. No sudden love or loyalty blossomed in them for Hindutva. Eknath Shinde wants us to prove our belief in the values of Hindutva... this is not acceptable. Shiv Sainiks lead by example and will continue doing the good work for one and all.” The resignation finally came on June 29, shortly after the Supreme Court refused to stay the floor test ordered by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition — comprising the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress — to prove its majority in the Assembly. Mr. Thackeray announced his resignation both as the Chief Minister and Member of the Legislative Council, but pledged to continue to work for the Sena. Sonali Mhatre, a mahila pramukh in Chunabatti, says, “Uddhav ji makes you feel like you are a part of his family. No one has ever felt they were interacting with a politician even before he became the Chief Minister. There is no arrogance and high-handedness. Uddhav ji and Aaditya ji are both down to earth. All of us were crying when he left the Chief Minister’s official residence.” Ramesh Rawal, a Sena functionary for the past 13 years in Byculla, says Balasaheb Thackeray had introduced the Hindutva ideology in Indian politics and now his son is being accused of being soft on Hindutva. “This is atrocious and will never be accepted. We have always worked and helped everyone irrespective of their religion and will continue to do so. Hindutva is in the blood and veins of every Shiv Sainik. No one needs to prove anything to anyone.” Shiv Sena workers take out a protest rally in support of party chief Uddhav Thackeray in Kolhapur on June 24.| Photo Credit:PTI Uddhav Thackerey arrives with his sons Aaditya and Tejas at Raj Bhavan on June 29 to submit his resignation as Chief Minister of Maharashtra to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.| Photo Credit:- Shiv Sena supporters stage a protest in support of Uddhav Thackeray at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on June 26.| Photo Credit:PTI Cloud of uncertainty looms: The office of the Shiv Sena’s branch in Worli, the Assembly constituency represented by Aaditya Thackeray, wears a deserted look.| Photo Credit: EMMANUAL YOGINI SDPO (Pandharpur division) Vikram Kadam said that on Friday, Katekar along with others had gone to the MSEB office in Pandharpur to protest seeking electricity bills across the state be waived off for the period of the Covid imposed lockdown.

In the wake of a political row in Maharashtra over the recitation of Hanuman Chalisa, the Shiv Sena on Monday hit out at the BJP and said the Hindutva ideology is a culture and not chaos. An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' claimed the BJP's ""rotten brain"" was behind independent MP Navneet Rana and her MLA husband Ravi Rana's earlier call to recite Hanuman Chalisa outside Maharashtra Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray's private residence 'Matoshree', that resulted in angry protests by Shiv Sainiks outside the couple's home here on Saturday. After a court in Assam's Kokrajhar district granted bail to Gujarat Independent MLA Jignesh Mevani in a case over a tweet by him against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, he was rearrested on the charge of ""assaulting and outraging"" the modesty of a woman police officer four days ago.

In PICS: Pakistan’s ex-PM Imran Khan arrest sparks massive violence across cash-strapped nation Bengaluru News Highlights, 11 Nov 2022: The Opposition JD(S) and Congress accused Karnataka’s BJP government of turning the unveiling of a statue of the 16th-century founder of Bengaluru, Kempegowda, into a party event on Friday. In a series of messages on social media, the JD(S) criticised the BJP for not inviting former prime minister H D Deve Gowda to the event despite the party president’s contributions to the city. The court of a civil judge and junior magistrate in Mangaluru has rejected an application filed by the authorities of a mosque in the Malalipete village in Mangaluru to reject a suit filed by two local activists to preserve structures in the mosque complex on account of the existence of an old temple. Following the unveiling of the Kempagowda statue by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivkumar tweeted it 'will not fill the stomachs of these gentlemen's community'. He said their problem will not be solved and the tears will not end. 'During the election, the Trouble Engine BJP government in Karnataka is doing politics by promoting the statue of gentlemen to cover up its corruption, scandal and dereliction of duty. But BJP's corrupt achievements and legitimacy have already been exposed before the people of the state,' he tweeted. Granting bail to Khatija Mehreen, who was arrested in 2021 in Uttara Kannada district, Justice Shivashankar Amarannavar said, “In the bail petition it is categorically stated that there is no prima facie case made out against the petitioner, but unfortunately is that the petitioner has become scapegoat in the hand of the complainant-police and she should not be detained in judicial custody merely on suspicion or doubt.” A slugfest over inviting leaders of the Opposition parties for the unveiling of a statue of Bengaluru's founder Nadaprabhu Kempegowda has erupted in Karnataka.The differences were over the protocol allegedly not being followed by the BJP-ruled State government in extending the invitation, particularly to former Prime Minister and JD(S) leader H D Deve Gowda.With JD(S) terming it as an insult to Gowda and people of the State, and accusing the government of turning the unveiling into a party event, the BJP hit back by releasing the letters written by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to various dignitaries inviting them and they included Deve Gowda. (PTI) ""It is a crime of HDMC that has allowed to celebrate Tipu Jayanti. We will be staging a protest against corporation. The present BJP government which banned Tipu Jayanti is now allowing to celebrate it. For the sake of power, BJP is ready to do everything,"" Sri Rama Sene chief Pramod Muthalik. A day before PM Modi’s visit, the state unit of the Congress wrote to him about “the pathetic states of affairs due to the corrupt BJP government in Karnataka and the shocking inaction by the central government”. The letter, jointly penned by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D K Shivakumar and legislature party leader Siddaramaiah, took a dig at the ‘double engine’ government and accused it of neglecting the state. The decision to notify the Malai Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka, popularly known as the MM Hills, as a tiger reserve was once again postponed by the wildlife board headed by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, officials confirmed Thursday. After the Janata Dal Secular (JDS) alleged that former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda was not invited for the inauguration of 108-feet bronze statue of Kempegowda, minister of higher education and IT BT Dr Ashwath Narayan Saturday said Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had himself invited Deve Gowda and all the former chief ministers of Karnataka for the event.Narayan said Bommai had invited Siddaramiah, H D Kumaraswamy and S M Krishna personally to the inauguration ceremony and that all political leaders have great respect for Deve Gowda.

The Islamic Resistance Council (IRC), a little-known outfit, has reportedly claimed responsibility for the blast, saying one of its 'Mujahid brothers Mohammed Shariq' attempted to attack a 'Hindutva Temple in Kadri'. Talking to reporters at Bommanakatte helipad, he said that the statement by the Karnataka State Wakf Board Chairman on the opening of separate college for the Muslim girls was only a statement and no such proposal is there before the government. This came a day after a video went viral showing a student of Gogte College of Commerce in Belagavi allegedly beaten up by other students after he waved the Karnataka flag. However, the police said there is no clarity why the student was attacked. (Read more) Karnataka's stand is that Maharashtra's plea regarding the border issue is not maintainable and the same will be argued by the state's advocates when the case comes up before the Supreme Court for hearing, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said.

Bhopal resident Prakash Mande accused the Congress Rajya Sabha member of tweeting a fake photo and tying it to the Khargone violence. New Delhi: After tweeting a photo of a mosque in another state while commenting on communal violence in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh, a case was filed on Tuesday against senior Congress politician Digvijaya Singh for allegedly spreading religious animosity, news agency PTI reported. Some social media users said the photo was of a mosque in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, while BJP politicians like Bhopal (Huzur) MLA Rameshwar Sharma questioned the picture's relation to the Khargone occurrences. The case was filed under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on the basis of religion, race, or place of birth), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings), 465 (forgery), and 505 (2) (public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code, according to the commissioner. According to the complaint, the tweet may have stoked communal tensions and harmed religious unity in Madhya Pradesh. According to Chouhan, the tweet is a plot to incite religious fervour in the state and provoke disturbances, which will not be accepted. Singh ""wants to fuel communal tension by spreading confusion,"" according to MP Home Minister Narottam Mishra, and the government will seek legal advice on what steps to take. On Sunday evening, a curfew was imposed in Khargone city after arson was sparked by stone-pelting during a Ram Navami parade. Is it proper to raise a flag at a sacred location while wielding swords and sticks? Was a parade with weapons permitted by the Khargone administration? Will bulldozers demolish the homes of all stone-throwers, regardless of religion? Don't forget, Shivraj ji, you took an oath to lead the government fairly, said Digvijaya Singh in a tweet with a photo.

This was attack not only on office of PM but on democracy itself. The move comes a day after the PM’s scheduled visit to Punjab’s Ferozepur was cancelled over a major “security lapse” that resulted in a blame game between the BJP and the Congress, which rules the state.

We then reached out to Manglani who said the photo does not show Pancholi but could not provide us with photos of the same scene where the policeman's badge was clearly visible. After having confirmed with visual clues that the viral photo does not show Pancholi, we contacted API Nadvinkeri who did not seem surprised about the viral claim but refused to comment further. We first contacted Aditya Pancholi who denied that it was him in the photo. ""I have seen these posts and that photo and people need to realise what a serious allegation they are levying on me and all of it on social media."" He added, ""Do they think it was some crime scene in a movie that I will dress up as a cop and go to his house? I was at home and these people are sharing these things. Why do they even think I will have a cop's uniform just sitting at home?"" Pancholi further said that the posts and allegation may seem laughable and absurd, but they are very serious. ""They did the same to Suraj (Pancholi's son) too. Compared his photo to someone walking out of the building wearing a T-Shirt. People should be responsible in these times when everything and anything can be shared on social media."" BOOM found that the policeman is not Aditya Pancholi but in fact a Mumbai police official attached to the Bandra police station. We identified him to be Avinash Nadvinkeri, an Assistant Police Inspector at the Bandra police station who was part of the team who reached actor Sushant Singh Rajput's house after the police were informed about his death.

Despite the manager’s family repeatedly denying any link between the two, this is one question that many can’t quite seem to shake off. We can all agree to disagree on various debates and discussions on the Sushant Singh Rajput case, but can we all confirm that the actor had mental health issues, to begin with? While at one point Sushant’s father claimed to have had “no idea” about his son dealing with any such issue, several psychiatrists, close associates, and of late, even the Singh family’s Whatsapp group conversations have made rather contradictory statements. Music composer Raj of the Raj-Koti duo passes away! Shortly after Sushant Singh, Rajput’s death went public, initial reports claimed that the actor was partying it up the night before his suicide. Reports even alleged that the building association heads had a problem with his late-night parties and wanted him out of the house. However, later reports seemed to suggest that the actor was not hosting any party owing to the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Sushant Singh Rajput’s personal diaries and the content they hold have come back into the spotlight after it was revealed that certain pages were “ripped out”. Will it ever be proved that the diary was “tampered” with or was it just Sushant who tore off the pages? Conspiracy theorists, on the other hand, beg to differ and suggest that it could have even been a third party trying to cover up something. When asked if he was in touch with Sushant In the recent past? Sooraj said, “No, I wasn’t. He was not a best friend of mine or anything. We had never been to each other’s houses. We were from the same industry, that’s all.” Talking about How true are the ‘Salman Khan is defending Sooraj’stories? He said, “Why would he do this for me? Salman Khan is the producer of my first film (Hero, 2015). He gave us a chance, and after that, it has been my journey. He is not responsible for what we do in the future. You need to find your way. I cannot rely on Salman sir and cannotexpect him to be my Godfather. I have never been dependent on him and he wouldn’t want it that way, too. In a recent interview, Sooraj Pancholi rubbishes conspiracy theories that allege his involvement in Sushant Singh Rajput and his former manager Disha Salian’s death. While it’s been speculated that Disha was pregnant with Sooraj’s child, and Sushant, who reportedly had a scuffle with him In 2017, was aware of It and was about to expose him. It’s also been said that Salman Khan has been protecting him. The actor breaks his silence on these rumours and says “What scuffle with Sushant? I never had any argument with him, which I have clarified before as well. And, why will Salman Khan get involved in my life? Does he not have other things to do? I don’t even know who Disha is, I have never met her in my life. I found out about her after Sushant’s death, and I feel bad for the families involved. Someone has written this rubbish on their personal Facebook page, made it into a movie script and put it out there.” When asked about no hostility between Sushant and Sooraj whatsoever? Sooraj Pancholi said, “None at all. He was a senior actor and way more successful. I was not in his league to even compete with him. I was nowhere a threat to him. He treated me like a younger brother. Whenever we met, we either spoke about films or my fitness training. When the article about our tiff came out in 2017, it was Sushant who had reached out to me. When asked, You already have a case looming over your head (Jiah Khan) and now, the Sushant- Disha tragedy has your name being dragged into it, Sooraj exclaims “I am very numb and hurt right now. This is affecting me a lot. I don’t know what to say. It’s been eight years and my case (Jiah) hasn’t been taken off and it’s only because Rabiya Khan (Jiah’s mother) doesn’t show up in court. I had to face the CBI since I was 21-22. I have cooperated with the police. I have done everything possible, haven’t missed a single date in court even when I was down with fever.

""Mr Modi is not our first PM and this is not India's first vaccination programme. But the campaign against Covid-19 and the vaccine programme is being projected as a one-man show, a propaganda tool for the prime minister."" Peter M says that is where the problem lies with having Mr Modi's face on his vaccine certificate. His concern is rooted in the fact that Mr Modi's photo sometimes pops up in places where it is not meant to be. Recently, a government advertisement with the prime minister's image was dropped from official court emails after objections from the Supreme Court.

Mamata Banerjee has now taken a slight lead against BJP's Suvendu Adhikari in the Nandigram constituency as the Election Commission conducts mandatory VVPAT verification. The under-par performances in Jharkhand, Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi after the party’s stellar performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections have raised questions over the erosion of the formidable political capital mobilised by Modi for his party.

As per current trends, Balachandran is ahead with Padmaja trailing him and Suresh Gopi in last place. This was one of the seats where the BJP had a lot of hopes of winning. The most damning indictment, however, is regarding using international media to dent Prime Minister Modi’s image. “International media coverage by foreign correspondents in India can be tailored to exclusively focus on Modi and his mismanagement. Liaise with foreign journalists and Indian Oped writers in foreign publications and brief them on talking points.” Quite clearly, it appears that global media has been taking instructions from the Congress party. It is known that international media has never been friendly towards the current ruling dispensation. On top of it, it appears that they have been peddling propaganda on behalf of the Congress party and publishing the opposition’s talking points as neutral objective opinion. News and opinion website that brings you reports and narrative from a perspective often ignored or suppressed by the mainstream media of India. A new Congress toolkit is circulating on social media that reveals the depths to which the party sank in order to mint their political fortunes amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. While the Congress claims that it is fake, the content of the toolkit speaks a different story. We, at OpIndia, could not independently verify the authenticity of the toolkit. One of the most significant revelations was that a deliberate attempt was made to paint the Kumbh Mela as a “super-spreader” while maintaining a carefully crafted silence over massive Eid gatherings. The Congress party also implores the use of funeral pyre photographs to further dent India’s image. “Such journalists can be facilitated by our local cadre in various districts to get the right image and then their reporting may be magnified,” the alleged toolkit says. It is not the first time they have tried such a thing. Unable to convince the Indian electorate to vote for them on their own, it appears they are relying on global forces, who do not have the best interests of India in their heart, to defeat Narendra Modi in elections. ""I'm ashamed to call myself a BJP worker,"" Goyal said. India's external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar, has addressed some of the criticism.

On May 5, the national BJP president, J.P. Nadda, held a news conference in West Bengal to talk about post-election violence in which some of the BJP's poll workers were allegedly attacked by supporters of a rival party. He was asked about COVID-19 and whether the party and prime minister were concerned about it. Anger and political arguments could focus next on Uttar Pradesh, a state where COVID-19 is raging. Next year, the state will hold legislative elections — which will be a key test for Modi, whose close confidant is the head of the state's government. Opposition politicians have tried to capitalize on that anger. Rahul Gandhi, head of the opposition Congress party, tweeted Monday that if Modi's government had ""done its job, it wouldn't have come to this."" His mother-in-law had a severe case of COVID-19, he said. He took her from hospital to hospital in what has become an all-too-familiar tale: Hospitals didn't have room, and his mother-in-law died. Jaishankar was in London last week for a meeting with foreign ministers from the G-7 advanced economies. (Although not in the G-7, India and several other nonmember countries were invited.) Some Indians were surprised Jaishankar would travel abroad during such a crisis. (While India is on the United Kingdom's travel ban ""red list"" of countries with high coronavirus rates, diplomats are exempt.) The Telegraph is more of an advocacy group than an actual media organization. During the 2019 general elections, its editor had claimed in an article removing Narendra Modi from power was the only hope for India’s redemption. The Bengal-based media house The Telegraph was called out by netizens for a headline that insulted the Dalit community as it compared the President of India, Ramnath Kovind, who is a Dalit leader himself, to ‘Covid19’. The meltdown came after President Kovind nominated ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha. Partha Chatterjee is a powerful minister in Mamata government. He is also secretary general of the ruling Trinamool Congress. Safe to say he is a close aide of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. On directions of the Calcutta High Court, the CBI is probing the irregularities in the Group-C and D staff as well as teachers recruitment in government sponsored and aided schools on recommendations of West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC). The Enforcement Directorate is following the cash trail. This, of course, isn’t the first time The Telegraph appears to be terrified of Mamata Banerjee. In October 2020, on a day when the goons allegedly associated with the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC, joined hands with the West Bengal Police and unleashed violence and mercilessly beat up people on the streets of Kolkata, the neutral media ‘Telegraph’ chose to remain a mute spectator against atrocities perpetrated by the West Bengal government. The Telegraph did not have any of its spiteful headlines it passes off as ‘witty’! The Telegraph, the English-language paper from ABP group published from Kolkata, West Bengal, often hailed by the ‘liberals’ in India for its anti-Modi headlines, has maintained strategic silence on the enormous amount of cash recovered from Arpita Mukherjee’s house. Mukherjee is a close aide of Partha Chatterjee, TMC leader and minister in Mamata government, currently under scanner over alleged involvement in SSC recruitment exams.

But what could explain significantly higher stunting rates in middle-income states? Third, urban slums and lack of sanitation is a potential contributor to stunting. Despite claims, India still lags behind sub-Saharan African countries in terms of safely managed sanitation services. States like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka have a significant population living in urban slums who do not have access to improved sanitation facilities. The difference in sanitation practices between Indian states and their African counterparts explains the difference in stunting rates. Based on this conceptualisation, economic factors like average per capita income and prevalence of multi-dimensional poverty are loosely correlated with the prevalence of high stunting in states of AP, Telangana, Gujarat, Maharashtra & Karnataka. Similarly, maternity care characteristics (ante-natal care during pregnancy, post-natal care and consumption of folic acid during pregnancy), although extremely important, but, are weakly associated with high stunting rates in these states. Despite relatively modest economic growth and favourable maternity characteristics, high prevalence of stunting in these states defies logic. After all, these states have been the flagbearers of India’s growth story since 1991. As countries move up the income ladder, the rates of stunting and wasting declines, a phenomenon observed globally. However, India is an outlier and breaks this causality. States with relatively high per capita incomes have stunting rates comparable to the poorest African countries. In many Indian states, the situation is worse than that of poor sub-Saharan African countries. For instance, Bihar, Manipur and West Bengal have similar per capita income ($) as sub-Saharan African countries — Liberia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe — but, the average stunting rates in Bihar (43 per cent), Assam (35 per cent) and West Bengal (34 per cent) are 10-12 per cent higher than that of Liberia (33 per cent), Tanzania (32 per cent) and Zimbabwe (3 per cent) respectively. The situation is worse when it comes to middle-income states like Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka with similar per capita income ($) as Peru, Egypt and Morocco. The average stunting rates in Goa (26 per cent) Maharashtra (35 per cent), Gujarat (39 per cent), Telangana (33 per cent) and Karnataka (35 per cent) are almost 10-15 per cent higher than that of Peru (12 per cent), Egypt (22 per cent) and Morocco (15 per cent). Understanding this paradox among Indian states, which has an unusually high level of stunting relative to their economic development, merits investigation. Despite this high prevalence, India has rarely undertaken a comprehensive study to understand the pathogenesis of stunting. Therefore, what we have is a lopsided understanding of the problem. As per WHO, stunting can be attributable to medical and socio-economic factors. The medical factors include genetics (parents’ height), access to nutrition and mother’s health (anaemia, BMI). Besides, there are economic factors — income, poverty, access to healthcare, mother’s education and labour force participation — and social factors — caste, race, women status and place of residence etc. Of these, which ones are proximate and which one the distant factors, we simply don’t know. First, women’s educational status, especially secondary and above, along with female labour force participation partly resonates with high stunting rates. Maternal literacy is an important determinant of a child’s nutritional status. Literate mothers are expected to be aware of their health, nutrition and breastfeeding practices. This finding, however, reflects the tragic reality of women bearing the undue burden of childcare. Second, the mother’s health, the prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age. India is one of the most anaemia-prone countries in the world. Children under age 5 and women of productive age are particularly vulnerable. Several studies have explored the strong association between stunting and the presence of anaemia in women of childbearing age. For instance, women of low BMI had greater odds of developing anaemia and the children of anaemic mothers are at greater risk of being stunted. The implication, a vicious circle of anaemia and stunting — stunted children of anaemic mothers are at greater risk of developing anaemia. The NFHS 5 data corroborate this finding — all women in reproductive age who are anaemic stands at 59 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, 40 per cent in Goa, 63 per cent in Gujarat, 48 per cent in Karnataka, 55 per cent in Maharashtra and 58 per cent in Telangana. The other, atypical factor that has an impact on the prevalence of stunting is genetics (mother’s height). As per WHO, the golden rule of measuring stunting in children is the height for age Z score (HAZ). A child is considered stunted if the HAZ score is two standard deviations below the median of WHO child growth standard. The height of children is closely associated with the height of mothers. For instance, the average female height in South Asia, including India, is approx. 150-156 cm, whereas, the average female height in Europe and Africa is 164-168 cm and 160-165 cm respectively. Genetic differences can explain the differences in the stock of stunted children in two regions, but it can’t be the dominant factor in explaining the flow of stunted children. The analysis, then, boils down to the real culprits — anaemia and low BMI among women, social and gender inequalities, which together manifest in the problem of malnutrition among children. However, the public distribution system is not necessarily a rebuttal to the fact that Indians suffer from malnutrition. India’s malnutrition problem, to some extent, comes from a poor quality of diet, which the PDS does not address. As a 2020 paper pointed out, Indians “consume excess amounts of cereals and not enough proteins, fruits, and vegetables”. In fact, the share of calories from protein sources for the average Indian is only 6%-8% in India compared to 29% in ideal circumstances. None of this is new. While matters have got worse in India the past few years, 22 years ago too, the country had been beaten by Pakistan in the Global Hunger Index. From a political point of view, the surprising fact about India’s poor performance is how little it matters in electoral politics. While the rankings might irritate the Bharatiya Janata Party, no one seriously believes malnutrition would be a major factor in the upcoming elections in, say, Gujarat or even in the national polls in 2024. Even more troubling is the fact that on some vital parameters, things are getting worse. India’s child wasting rate at present is worse than the data from two decades ago. And more Indians are undernourished today than they were in 2013-2015. The recent pandemic, it is now clear, led to “severe nutrition crisis”, a 2021 paper by economists Jean Drèze and Anmol Somanchi pointed out. India’s ham-handed response to Covid-19, where it put in place a draconian lockdown, hit employment as well as health systems hard. However, rather than blame the government for announcing an unprepared lockdown, it is clear that the Indian voter looks at the pandemic overall as an act of God. In effect, the score is largely a measure of child health, pointing to the fact that Indian babies and toddlers are alarmingly malnutritioned. In fact, as the report points out, “India’s child wasting rate, at 19.3 percent, is the highest of any country in the world”. India’s poor performance and size ends up making South Asia the region with the world’s “highest hunger level”. This is partly due to poverty (Indians cannot afford high-quality food sources) and partly religio-cultural.  Powerful interest groups have even opposed eggs being made part of the free lunch most states provide to school children in spite of the fact that nutritionally, eggs are seen as a near-perfect source of protein by experts. A decade ago, Narendra Modi, when he was chief minister of Gujarat had, in fact, used the fact that many Gujaratis were vegetarian to try and explain why malnutrition was so high in the state in spite of being industrially developed. On a longer time-scale, malnutrition in India is highly correlated with fundamental social factors such as gender and caste. The Indian government reacted to the report, faulting its methodology. This was expected – it was also its response last year. As Dipa Sinha, a faculty at Ambedkar University, Delhi and an expert on food rights, nutrition and public health had pointed out in 2021, the government’s objections were not factual and “all the data used are from official data sources of respective national governments”. In fact, the Indian government’s own data shows that the malnutrition problem in the country is acute. Notably, almost all the points listed above – gender, caste and dietary norms – are deep-seated cultural factors that politics has little power to change in the short term. This might be the principal reason that while India might have vigorously contested elections, its shocking malnutrition problem rarely features in any prominent way during a campaign. One of the biggest reasons why children in India are underweight is that they are born to malnutritioned mothers. According to a 2019 paper by the Indian Council of Medical Research, “the higher proportion of underweight women in the reproductive age group in India compared with sub-Saharan Africa has been suggested to contribute to a higher prevalence of low birthweight in India, even though sub-Saharan Africa is poorer”. The nutritional indicators of Indian children were already among the worst in the world, with around 35% of them stunted or underweight or both in 2015-’16. This is worse than several poorer or slower-growing countries in the world, including some in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Health Organisation’s global targets tracking tool, India falls in the red zone in the incidence of child stunting and wasting. Data from the National Family Health Survey also show an increase in the proportion of overweight children across states between 2015-’16 and 2019-’20, although the numbers are low. This reinforces a pattern that has already been noted – the triple burden of malnutrition in India. Undernutrition for large sections of the population co-exists with obesity for a small section of the population and pervasive micronutrient deficiencies. The disaggregated data are not yet available but we know from earlier surveys that children who belong to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have significantly worse nutritional parameters and mortality rates than other children. Between 2015-’16 and 2019-’20, stunting in children under five increased in six of the 10 large states – Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Telangana and West Bengal. Stunting, or low height-for-age, is considered an indicator of cumulative nutritional deficiencies from conception, and of the long-term health of the child. Child wasting, or low weight-for-height, and being underweight, or low weight-for-age, reflect more short-term nutritional deficiencies. These indicators also worsened or remained unchanged in seven of these 10 states. The key indicators of health and nutrition from the fifth round of the National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2019-’20, paint a disconcerting picture. Gains in child nutrition, reflected in the previous rounds, conducted in 2005-’06 and 2015-’16, have been reversed in several states. With the pandemic and the economic crisis, nutritional indicators are likely to worsen further. The factors that determine how much nutrition children get include the disease environment, the education, health and nutrition of women, parental education, access to public services and household amenities, and the use of sanitation facilities. While the National Family Health Survey suggests improvements in access to basic amenities, we show in a recent working paper that access is still very limited. In 2018, 67% of the population did not have access to piped drinking water, 21% did not have access to toilets, and 40% did not have access to LPG. In urban areas, the heads of only about 21% of slum-dwelling households held a ration card. While the allocation of additional foodgrain under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was a welcome initiative, Jean Drèze, Reetika Khera and Meghana Mungikar have pointed out that millions are excluded from the public distribution system, which is based on outdated Census figures. Hunger and malnutrition continue to be acute problems even months after the lockdown ended. Hunger Watch, a survey of over 4,000 people from vulnerable and marginalised communities across 11 states conducted by the Right to Food campaign, found that about 27% of the respondents sometimes went to bed without eating in September-October. Moreover, 71% reported that the nutritional quality of their food had worsened from what it had been before the lockdown. Taliban misogyny has worsened a hunger crisis we mustn’t ignore The Taliban’s takeover will make all these problems more acute, because poverty, undernourishment and gender inequality go hand-in-hand. Although women and girls tend to be more resilient in the face of malnutrition, in patriarchal societies they also suffer the worst deprivation and long-term side-effects, as more food is allocated to the males of the household. According to the research group Afghanistan Analysts Network, the price of essential items, from flour to cooking oil, has risen while the afghani currency depreciates. In a second-hand market in Kabul, desperate families are selling household goods to buy food. Even before this year’s crisis, Afghanistan was stalked by hunger because of a devastating drought in 2018 and 2019. Only North Korea and six nations in sub-Saharan Africa were making do with fewer daily calories, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Thanks to drought and pandemic effects, wheat flour prices in Kabul have been about 20% above historical averages for most of the year. That’s likely to get worse: If you think supply-chain problems in rich countries are leading to shortages and inflation, it’s nothing compared to the sort of civil chaos and uncertainty that’s descended on Afghanistan. Afghan women’s top fear is not being able to work, and losing access to education is a close second, says Heather Barr, associate director of women’s rights at Human Rights Watch. With so many men killed in the conflict, or fleeing the country, a significant number of women have been left as both single parents and sole breadwinners supporting their parents and other relatives. “The Taliban cutting off women’s ability to work is not about their feelings of empowerment—though this is important—it is about losing any ability to feed themselves and their family,"" Barr notes. Not many will say it publicly but indigenous Assamese Muslims, despite their formidable social capital, are also ill at ease with Sarma’s new-found belligerence. “To tell you frankly, all Muslims feel threatened, whether indigenous or immigrant,” said Abu Nasar Saied Ahmed, a sociologist and a former professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Guwahati. “I am an indigenous Assamese Muslim, yet I am not in a position to speak freely.” Lack of structural improvements in public health go a long way in explaining the frequency of assaults on doctors in Assam. Even before the pandemic struck, doctors would often get caught in the crosshairs of angry relatives of patients, particularly in the tea estates where many health indices are comparable to Sub-Saharan Africa. Ajmal, Sarma has said time and again, was an “enemy of Assam” and symbolic of “the most dangerous phase of Assam’s politics”. The Congress, which had allied with the AIUDF had to be thwarted at any cost, Sarma averred, because if the Congress won, it would actually be Ajmal who would have won. But Sarma dug his heels, insisting that the amended citizenship law would not destroy the Assamese community but save it from the “invaders”, a barb directed at Muslims of Bengali origin. His stance angered the protesters to such an extent that he was labelled “enemy of the Assamese people”. Sarma, however, insisted that the anger was ephemeral and did not represent the true sentiments of the average non-Muslim voter in the state. The accused, according to the police, were related to a patient who had reportedly died of Covid-19-related complications at the centre. The attack was seemingly provoked by what they believed was negligence by the doctor in attending to the patient. Dutta argued that it flowed from the state’s first chief minister Gopinath Bordoloi’s fight against the Muslim League’s “divisive” plan of grouping Assam with Bengal to create a Muslim majority bloc and ultimately pave the way for it to be made part of  East Pakistan. “It was a fight against the Muslim League’s divisive politics, not against Muslims, but the projection over the years has become such that it is seen as being against Muslims,” he said. By then, the damage had been done. With exactly a year to the Assembly elections in the state, the embers of polarisation had been lit. In Golaghat district, many Assamese-speaking Muslim villages – a community traditionally considered part of the Assamese nationalist project as opposed to Muslims of Bengali origin – were barricaded by Hindu neighbours, preventing them from accessing essential services. A Muslim cleric from the area had at the time told this reporter that he had never seen such intense communal tensions in the area. “Efficiency is manufactured by people in the mainstream, particularly the media, people who are not personally affected by substandard government schools and conditions like anaemia and malnutrition,” said Dutta. Another portfolio that Sarma has held for a substantial period of time in both the Congress and BJP governments is education. In the Sustainable Development Goals index, Assam is in the lowest band of states when it comes to education metrics – its score worse than all states save four. But not everyone is as optimistic. Nath, the political scientist, said he feared Sarma would go for the jugular sooner than later. “I think the delimitation exercise (of Assembly constituencies) that they promised in the manifesto is coming soon,” he said. “With that he would make the immigrant Muslims even more marginalised, take away whatever political capital they have now.” Despite these advantages of organic farming, there are a few drawbacks that tarnish its image as a lucrative practice. To begin with, a study suggests that the yielding capacity of this method is so low that it is insufficient to feed the ever-growing world population. Another report reveals how there is an absence of clear indicators that show organic fruits and vegetables offer higher nutritional content as compared to their conventional counterparts. Finally, organic products tend to be more expensive, sometimes their mark-up is as high as 40 percent, making them unaffordable for the masses."

But he also appears to believe that meat shops are owned and mostly frequented by Muslims - and that all Hindus across India, or even Delhi, celebrate Navratri. Game meat was integral to Indian diets since 70,000BC, says Manoshi Bhattacharya, a clinical nutritionist who has researched Indian dietary traditions. ""We are vegetarians who 'also' eat meat,"" Dr Bhattacharya says. History suggests that beef and wild boar were consumed widely in ancient India as far back as the Indus valley civilisation. Animal and cow sacrifices were common in the Vedic era, between 1500 and 500BC - the meat was offered to the gods and then consumed at feasts. But as with every rule in Indian cuisine, there is an exception - some brahmin communities still eat meat. Kashmiri Pandits are famed for their rogan josh, a rich gravy of lamb or goat meat cooked with a heavy dose of red chillies; in Bengal and along the southern Konkan coast, a variety of fresh fish is eaten in brahmin homes. ""India has a very old meat-eating tradition and a very deep vegetarian tradition, which is also important. But I am often forced into taking a position [to defend one over the other]."" The result is a diverse and delectable table which includes meat without always making it the hero of the meal. ""It's deeply unfortunate because Indian traditions are more complex than that,"" says Vikram Doctor, an editor at The Economic Times who writes extensively about the country's food. But the trend points the other way - meat consumption is growing, propelled by factory-farmed chicken. The most-ordered dish on Indian food delivery platform Swiggy last year was chicken biryani. Indians ordered two plates every second. And that is Mr Doctor's point as well - India, he says, is one of the only cultures in the world where vegetarianism was adopted early on among the elite, even as others continued eating meat. Industry experts said other companies, including Memphis Meats, Mosa Meat and Aleph Farms, might do well in future as they were working on textured products such as steaks and were able to produce significant amounts of lab-grown meat from the start. Tyson and Cargill, two of the world’s biggest conventional meat companies, now have a stake in Memphis Meats. “It seems certain that similar products from other companies will follow,” he said. “There has been so much hype on cell-cultured meat that the anticipated first steps to mass sales is a significant moment.” Hsin Huang, the secretary general of the International Meat Secretariat, which represents the global meat and livestock industry, agreed the cultured meat approval was a significant moment. But he said major challenges remained, with the reaction of consumers to cultured meat perhaps being the most significant: “Is it different? For sure. Our hope is through transparent communication with consumers, what this is and how it compares to conventional meat, we’re able to win. But it’s not a guarantee.” He said the cultured chicken was nutritionally the same as conventional meat. The idea of eating raw meat might freak you out, but many cultures around the world love eating meat raw. However, in the context of Indian cuisine, it might still sound bizarre, but around the world eating raw fish and meat is just an usual trend, but the question arises is it safe to eat raw meat. Here's all you need to know before you grab a bite! Priyanka's must have with every meal is this desi traditional food No wonder, eating meat might take your imagination back to the age of human evolution, but did you know from Europe to Asian countries, eating raw and parboiled meat and fish is not so unusual as it seems, but it can be the reason for most of your ailments. Yes, raw meat carries the bacteria and pathogens from that animal's body, which can lead to several ailments like food poisoning and other foodborne diseases like typhoid, jaundice to name a few. -Always marinate your meat and then cook it. The spices and herbs like garlic, ginger, salt, turmeric and vinegar, help in reducing the pathogens. Across culture, raw meat is often relished with spices, and bacteria killing herbs and extracts, but does that keep pathogens at bay? Well, the answer will disappoint you, but some studies say that raw meat is full of nutrition, but none of these studies rule out the presence of harmful infectants. Hence, the best way to eat meat is by cooking them properly, so that the viruses, bacteria and pathogens are destroyed while cooking. However, there are several dishes around the world that are prepared with raw meat and cooking them would simply change the taste and texture. Eating raw meat has always been a matter of debate; On one hand some experts believe that cooking meat can reduce the concentration of nutrients in the meat, on the other hand some experts claim that eating meat has more cons than pros! Hence, here a few tips you can follow to ensure that the meat you eat is safe to eat, even if it is raw! They say “eat what your grandmother cooks.” My grandmother cooks beef, my grandmother cooks dry fish. So why is it that my culture suddenly is not cultured? We all need to start asking that. Why has your grandmother’s food — and not mine — become a national recommendation now? Dr. Sylvia Karpagam: So first of all, the body size of Indians is not a standard. If Indians are given adequate, good quality, diverse, nutrient-dense foods that constitute a well-balanced diet, they wouldn’t have small frames. If you compare populations in India that have had good food over generations, they have consistently shown an increase in height. If some Indians have a smaller frame, it’s not something that we should just dismiss as a given — we should actually ask why so many Indians have a small frame when it’s possible to have better heights and weights. The small frame is because of stunting in childhood and because the mother never received adequate nutrition during pregnancy and her adolescent years. So the role of the government — through the educational system — is to make sure that people have both accurate knowledge about nutrition, and also access to all nutritious foods. And then, there’s also a lot of anger toward people from marginalized communities asserting their constitutional rights based on what the Constitution gives. So I think it is also to make the Constitution less relevant in terms of how India is governed. We as doctors or nutritionists only have to bust some of these myths scientifically, then I think people can take it up and say: “This is a food we’ve always been eating. Research says is important for us. It’s good for us. We want those to be part of the policy.” Unless that happens, this indoctrination is going to keep happening. The dilemma of a parent will always be what are the best food choices I can make for my child. Be wise and use the most tried and tested options for your children which have not failed and have been in use for decades. Help kids to be more acquainted with their ancestors' food, they will get an opportunity to get connected to their roots. Understanding the source of where what comes from, and how things grow is a great way to build a rock-solid foundation. They say, we are what we eat and so food will never be only about great taste but also about great living, health, and sustainability. And great food will always have a great story to tell. This now means that while the intent, when we started, was noble, food companies are resorting to the same practice that today has made animal husbandry the number one cause of global climate changes with almost irreversible effects. “Food is so much related to our culture and how we live. In major events in our life, food is a main component. When you talk about diet, there’s a notion of ‘I don’t want to stop eating the foods we like.’” While Parra Cano follows a mostly vegetarian diet, she does eat meat occasionally, such as food hunted by her husband and buffalo jerky prepared by an Indigenous food company. Eating together has always been important to his family. He wants his restaurant to have options so families can share a meal regardless of their vegan, vegetarian or omnivore diets. “By default, just by cooking Mexican food there’s going to be some connection to Indigenous culture of Mexico,” Lebron said. “For instance, corn has been highly revered in Mexico by many many tribes.” Families and friends want to eat together and if one person in the group doesn't eat meat, this could deter people from eating at her family's restaurant, she said. Lopez-Pentecost, who’s vegetarian, said that even within her own family, the first reaction to meatless dishes is that they won’t taste as good. Meat is such a dominant part of today’s mainstream diet that an educational aspect is required to show vegetarian foods are flavorful too, she said. Parra Cano grew up eating and cooking traditional Mexican foods, but her most intimate relationship with food began after experiencing difficult pregnancies. Many of the foods she has cooked or offers online through Sana Sana are medicinal foods her own mother prepared during Parra Cano’s pregnancies, foods she ate while recovering from postpartum preeclampsia, and then what she describes as ancient foods: Cholla buds, blue corn pinole, pumpkin atole, beans, granola with popped amaranth and sunflower seeds. When people ate meat in pre-Hispanic times, people mostly ate what they could hunt, and did not eat meat for every meal, said Felicia Cocotzin Ruiz, a Xicana and Tewa author and Indigenous foods activist in Phoenix. She is also a curandera, a traditional folk healer in Latin American communities. She described her diet at mostly plant-forward with an emphasis on legumes for protein. Lebron said that when she initially went vegan, the mock meats and highly-processed soy food products at the grocery store didn't seem like a good trade-off. She approached her husband Kevin, a professional chef for 20 years, and asked him to make her foods she would enjoy eating. Madam there’s always a beginning and banning consumption of dogmeat is very good for that. You can’t straight up go ban chicken and pork consumption, people would go nuts as they are in so much majority. The itch of mainland Indians to ‘civilise’ andamanese tribal hasn’t gone. Human meat ban another example From ants to snails to yes, dogs, various tribes and communities in the region have consumed different kinds of meat for generations, which have been also a marker of their cultural identity. That post by Azan Siddiqi was a real beat royal punch rt dwn the middle of whoever is peddling this awesome BS thatDog meat is a legall food available to the people of India & that the people at the center have no rt in prohibiting its consumption. No1 could have put it more brilliantly than you in hearing this report apart. my dr friend any sensible civilized person or even any sensible& responsive political party will do what the party at the center has done. Going they the posts its quite obvious that not many will are what the writer had expressed. May be her personal opinion but no ma’am, plz go paddle your wasted elsewhere, no ones buying it OK. Another Thing it takes a lot of guts to host a post like that and face the brick bats that followed and printed that too.I love that that’s very fair on your part. Thumbs Up for that. Oh BTW printing or taking up such silly misguided posts isn’t going to earn you any brownie points. you’ll be shedding many readers, and that I guess is more imp than brownie points… Dogs,chicken,cow pig any animals or classified because we humans classified them in those categories for our own convince but the eternal truth is all of them have a soul which comes under one classification. ‘They eat anything and everything’ is used often as a racial slur against northeast Indians, whose diet includes meat/flesh of animals, insects, mammals, that most mainlanders would balk at. By that logic is it ok to eat human meat as well ?? btw this is not something only India has done. A similar law was introduced in the USA in 2018 banning dog and cat slaughter for meat.And also why ban hunting endangered animals ? Are we discriminating  one species over another.Your article is completely one sided. I see your point but just want to bring to your attention the whole thing is not so simple. Tina Das has little understanding of the north-east and the same is visible in her articles.Name any well respected and civilized country/community where dog meat is acceptable as diet?If we are to follow her “logic” we would end up consuming bats and pangolins too. God knows how many more pandemics will emerge because of our food habits. Well i do get the intent of the article but do understand the whole north east does not savour dog meat. The article seems to project that dog meat is the staple diet of the whole region, whilst i do agree with the fact dog meat finds itself on the platter only in this region but its not the whole region. But then you chose to put the whole region in one bucket and that is a clear misinterpretation of the actual demographics in the region. I can understand your zeal and enthusiasm but let that not shadow other facts.These are some facts and not my personal views. Really lame click bait article!!Dogs have been companions to humans from time immemorial!!Dogs have a higher understanding compared to other animals, heck even some humans.Chicken, Turkey, Pork, Mutton and beef are reared to be slaughtered. It’s called animal husbandry, Google it.It’s not about deciding what Northeastern people should eat or not, it’s about basic common sense, which you the Author of this article and the dog meat eaters lack. If they were cannibals, I’m sure you would write another article saying India isn’t democratic anymore cuz people from “Mainland India” think killing people ruthlessly and eating them is frowned upon or is in human.Oh and ofcourse to finish it in your style,“Views are personal” Upside Foods founder and CEO Uma Valeti said on Twitter that its cultivated chicken “was one step closer to being on tables everywhere.” The US Food and Drug Administration has given a safety clearance to lab-grown meat for the first time."

The top 10% of the Indian population holds 77% of the total national wealth. 73% of the wealth generated in 2017 went to the richest 1%, while 67 million Indians who comprise the poorest half of the population saw only a 1% increase in their wealth.(ref: bit.ly/3rT2y3T) All other countries are two party systems. India is multi party. Hence Modi wins even with 30% vote. The highest Congress ever got was 42% in 1984 after the death if Indira Gandhi. 305 seats does not mean 60% vote. It still means 30% vote with a multi party opposition.. In India, many employments, mostly of women, are not recorded. For instance, more than 80% of the house holds in Bangalore, my city, employ maids. Have you ever seen a database for such employment? About 30% of road side vegetable and fruit vendors in my locality are women. There is also an iron lady (a lady who irons clothes) in my colony. I play golf (which is an economy that affords employment to a considerable number of men and women) considered a sin by many and resented as a snobbish sport. There are many caddies (employed in golf courses) in Bangalore who hail from UP, Bihar, WB and Assam. Most of them live single with their wives tending the small plots of land back home, cultivating seasonal crops, some vegetables and rearing a cow (buffalo) or two. I wonder if these employments are accounted for. Nobody here reports these expenditures / incomes. It is still exactly a month before we will know what the voters decide in these five assembly elections. The numbers obviously won’t be what Amit Shah is counting after each phase in West Bengal. But whatever these are, one thing they won’t reflect is the state of India’s economy. It is 94% of the TOTAL Indian labor force that works in the Informal sector in India. So you are angry because he wrote a polite article instead of spewing vitriol? Your arguments about Putin are all wrong. Russia’s per capita GDP is higher because of rich moscow region. Most people there earn ten thousand rubles per month. And that is like ten thousand rupees. Their problem with muslim countries had little to do with religion. Those areas were ruled by Russians for a long time before soviets took over. Modi is not ruling Kashmir simply with guns as recent DDC polls showed it. As for standing up to Xi, putin himself is only bullying small states around Russia. And chinese have gone back from most of the places where they made incursions in 2020. Whatever you say, Gujrat is really a better industrial place than many parts of India. I also know Modi is resposible for much mess in India, but your arguments paint a more malicious picture. If whole India was suffering greatly, Modi’s Hindutva balloon would have burst already. It is going to burst anyway. And since I do not have enough time, I am not talking about minority appeasement during UPA rule. You have written what I have been writing on SG’s Youtube posts for over 2 years. However, neither he nor his team have made a single editorial where they have counted on Modi’s positive reforms, all in one go. Positives about modi come in bits and pieces. Mostly its just criticism.However, I have to hand it to SG that his has been the only channel to cover in some detail the banking reform i.e. IBC. It was unimaginable before to create such a law to retrieve lost capital from fraudulent businesses. His has also been one of the few channels to cover the infrastructure development led across the country by Nitin Gadkari. Fact is, upper middle class Indians  as well as rich Indians, particularly the very highly skilled are quietly leaving the country. And taking their cash with them. Capital flight during the UPA 2 regime from 2009-14 period amounted to USD 5.4 Billions. In the first 5 years of the Modi regime, USD 45 Billions has left India (ref: bit.ly/31ZoVdH) and that is a 9 fold increase. To these legal outflows, one must also add the colossal illegal outflows through over- and under-invoicing, hawala, Participatory Notes etc. etc. An analysis of the scheme’s performance based on data from the government’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell showed that while the number of LPG connections across India increased by 16.26% in 2016-’17, the use of gas cylinders increased by only 9.83% – lower than the rate recorded in 2014-’15, when the scheme did not exist. As for crores who got bank accounts, there is little point if they are empty.  Where are the 15 lakhs of black money to be brought from outside ?  We only saw defaulters who shared platform with Modi in Davos have escaped. Imran khan allowed kartarpur corridor but sikhs spent the money $500millions not pakistan government. All religions, without any exception, are man-made. None of the present day religions existed ten thousand years ago. And the beginning of human history goes back to millions of years. You should also go to Pakistan. Don’t just spend a week there, spend a year.Then you’ll realize how much freedom you’ll enjoy.  I’m a Catholic, not born there. I spent 21 years in Pakistan. Went to Catholic school there. Half the students in school were Muslims n other monorities. Worked there for 11 years. Almost all my co workers were Muslims.  Never, ever had I ever been discriminated or ill treated. In fact, my best friends in school were Muslims. First day of my work, all Muslim co workers welcomed me with mithai/sweets. I left Pakistan for better economic reasons. I still have cousins there, doing well,with goods jobs n own their own homes. Since I came to Canada, I have been back there 7 times, even with my wife n 2 children born in Canada. My wife who is not from Pakistan, loved the country so much, that she even said she would love to retire there. Please think about this, rather than condenming Pakistan each n every way. It’s the ignorant, illitrate moulanas that brain wash the gullible n ignorant,  and innocent Muslim youth to cause problems for the poor Christians, of course with the corruct n wicked politians. Majority of people are not aware of meaning of God/Allah/Khuda/ Christ/Ram what they have conveyed to human beings on this earth. Humanity is thousands miles away from them. Except few who are serving the humanity without considering what religious beliefs they are having. Why hate any one. Read the history of Sher-e-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji by English writers ( Google reviews. )  He donated gold for Sunehri Masjid of Lahore and equally distributed to Shiva Mandir of Kanshi along with Golden Temple, Amritsar without any partiality to any individual on his belief. And he was considered the best ruler of the world. Consider everyone as human being and not based on what he/she is and hatred towards any one. This is the message of Almighty for everyone. Understand the needs of humanity in distress Coronavirus period. CORONA-19 is deadly enemy of all races whatever faith you are having. Be a beautiful person on this Globe in this hour crisis. Mr Amin, for you kind info, we are not bigot  and narrow minded as you. India  have most number of maszids in world more than any Islamic country.and you Pakistanis have  broken all non islamic structure in last 70 years.  Let alone structure,  you have genocided  majority of  non muslims. There can’t be any comparison between  you and us.  And Pakistan is just a would be colony of China. We  are teaching big lesson to China who killed 15 lakh uighur muslims and you guys does not guts to even speak about that. Don’t worry we’ll avenge on your behalf. Pakistan is pure rog state they have been continuous forceful converting Hindus to Mulsim after independence,  earlier in Karachi 42% population was hindu , now only 4% or less , You are showing only one aspect of the story that’s how you are misleading the general public of India. Pakistan government and opposition didn’t oppose the construction of Hindu temple. In fact the government has given Hindus 4 canals piece of land for free to Hindus. But the Hindus are asking for 10 crores extra money for construction which is heavily criticised by the public and government is also reviewing this decision. So what’s wrong with that? We have given them free land and we also has given them permission but we cannot give them 10 crores. That’s the whole story but Indian media as expected misleading it’s public by not explaining the while situation so that the Indian citizen cannot know that Pakistani government has been doing so much for minorities as compared to India who are demolishing mosques. Babri was built to demolish Hinduism. It was lying vacant hence demolished. There are lakhs of mosques in India probably more than all put together in muslim world. I don’t know why indian Muslim’s are always taking side of Pakistan looks like they get paid from Pakistan government not from india, I used to watch every social media they don’t even support india but they stays in india. In India there is equal rights for every religion. #indian #freedom #forall Authorities halting the construction of a Shri Krishna Mandir in Islamabad’s H-9 sector last week is yet another reminder of how the space for religious freedoms is shrinking in Pakistan. The temple would have been the first new place of worship for the 3,000 Hindus residing in the capital. But not anymore. Crypto exchanges raised over USD 638 million last year from venture capital investors as investors made a beeline, despite the lack of regulatory clarity on the matter. The exact amount of crypto investments by Indians is unclear as there is no way to gauge those. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers in the capital markets, pulling out Rs 3,624.48 crore Monday, as per provisional data. The Centre has allocated Rs 73,000 crore for the rural jobs guarantee programme MGNREGA for 2022-23 in the Union Budget presented on Tuesday.

On Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 2022-23 Budget, Former FM and Congress leader P Chidambaram on Tuesday said, ""Today's budget speech was the most capitalist speech to be ever read by an FM. The word 'poor' occurs only twice in para 6 and we thank FM for remembering that there are poor people in this country; people will reject this capitalist budget."" He said that the Budget was on the behest of very rich people in the country. ""Instead of RBI, FM has virtually announced that Cryptocurrency is legal from today. Now all of this is not beneficial to 99.99% of people of India,"" Chidambaram added.

As per the 2001 Census, sex ratio among Muslims is 936 women per thousand males which is only slightly better than the national average of 933. For Hindus, the figure is 931 ..” Now lets focus on those 40 crore.And if 20% are poor as per surveys and reports then 8 crore people are poor even in the most optimistic case to support reservations!!!But this means 8 crore people and many before have faced discrimination for last 70+ years but None of secular or so called Democratic elite comes forward to speak of it. Why is it you demand only a ban on me ?  And not on the 95% of Hindu Nazis who write here ?    That sounds very Nazi to me. When Hindus lived peacefull during Mughal period? Take example of Aurangazeeb , he forcefully converted millions of Hindus to Islam and imposed Jizya tax on non muslims , killed millions of non muslims especially Hindus , fortunately he can’t invade south. Pl remember the present Indian sub continent Muslims were Hindus once and converted to Islam during Mughal period.

Taking that forward, Ms Banerjee said, ""He made Bengal seem like a nightmare land, like a state that is doing badly, underdeveloped, with no jobs... Did you see Bengal 11 years back? How can you compare? Now Bengal is sparkling and shining and I think he is jealous and saying all these things."" ""When the Home Minister of the country says something, it should be backed by data, facts and figures. Bengal is ahead of other states on all development indices. But Amit Shah ji deliberately tried to depict a gloomy and dismal picture of the state. I was challenged... Challenge accepted. Challenge I gave full reply with data,"" Ms Banerjee said. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday fact-checked Union Home Minister Amit Shah on his searing criticism on Sunday of her government's performance and said he owed her a treat as government of India stats on Bengal's social and economic parameters proved him wrong. Amit Shah, on the second day of his weekend visit to Bengal, had slammed what he called lawlessness and stunted progress in Bengal on ""Didi's"" watch. Copyright©2023 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today At a time when the crypto market is in chaos due to the collapse of FTX, the Indian government is firming up its stand against virtual currencies. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, emphasized on Friday, the use of the ‘darknet’ by terrorist groups to spread radicalized content and that there is a need to find solutions to such dark networks which saw an uptick in the use of cryptocurrency. The Home Minister was addressing the third 'No Money for Terror' Ministerial Conference and stressed on the need to build efficient operational systems against virtual asset channels. He said that despite fortifying the security architecture and financial systems, the terror groups are still successful in radicalizing youth and also raising funding for it. Amit Kapoor, honorary chairman at IFC, had told Alt News over an email conversation, “It is not accurate to refer to a study by an MOC affiliate as a Harvard study.” Kapoor also informed, “Contrary to media reports our study doesn’t conclude UP government handled the migrant crisis more effectively than other states. The document is not a comparative statement on the handling of the crisis by different states. It is documentation pertaining to the effort of the Uttar Pradesh government and extracting insights from the same.” “The document was for internal consumption and was not intended to be made public. In addition, as you note, the study/ document was not projected as a Harvard study anywhere in the document, rather as a work of the Institute For Competitiveness. The interpretation was unexpected. The logo from the report will be removed to correct the interpretation and to not project anything wrong,” he continued. In the month of April, two studies were incorrectly projected by the media as studies by Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University lauding the UP government for managing the migrant crisis and Covid-19 better than other states. These claims were further amplified on social media and WhatsApp. The study that was falsely attributed to Harvard especially gained a lot of traction with even prominent journalists tweeting about it. However, neither the claims nor the attribution was correct. Despite clarifications published two months ago, UP CM Yogi Adityanath presented these studies to the Home Minister, the President and the Prime Minister. The false claims were also repeated on a WhatsApp group where the UP government communicates with journalists. A news agency reported that another “similar study” by Johns Hopkins was also presented to the Prime Minister. Two months ago, several media organisations wrongly hailed Uttar Pradesh as a topper in Covid management citing a report by Johns Hopkins. Dr David Peters, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Department of International Health, who is one of the authors of the study, had refuted claims made by Indian media. According to IFC’s website, it is “the Indian knot in the global network” of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness (ISC) at Harvard Business School. IFC doesn’t refer to itself as a part of Harvard Business School. ISC prospectus lists IFC as an affiliate of MOC, which is essentially a Harvard course on competitiveness and economic development. It was developed by Professor Michael Porter and the staff and affiliates of ISC. There have been reports of a growing political tussle between the central government and the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, which goes to poll next year. Speculations of a rift are circulating amid PM Modi’s mishandling of Covid-19 and Adityanath facing flak over the rising number of dead bodies found in Ganga. UP CM has dismissed rumours of BJP’s unhappiness with his leadership. On June 10, he met Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. A photograph from the meeting shows Adityanath handing over a book to him titled ""Covid-19 & The Migrant Crisis Resolution: A Report On Uttar Pradesh."" Back in April, the same study was hailed by certain news outlets as Harvard University lauding the Yogi Adityanath government for handling the migrant crisis more effectively than other states. Alt News had revealed that the study was not prepared by Harvard University but IFC. The study was shared on a WhatsApp group ‘State Media 1’ where the UP government communicates with journalists. This time as well, the study was misrepresented as a Harvard study and shared on the same group. Describing terrorism as the worst form of human rights violation, the Home Minister said a general consensus would have to be developed on the definitions of “terrorism” and “terrorist”. The narratives of “good” and “bad” terrorism and “small” and “big” terrorism would weaken the fight against the threat which was high on Interpol’s priority list. Also, cross-border terrorism spread through online radicalisation could not be viewed as any political ideology. national government/terrorism (crime)/act of terror/human rights/India Copyright©2023 Living Media India Limited.

The Railway Board has also not forwarded any investigation report of NIA to CRS… Hence, it is not possible to conclude the cause of the accident,” states the report. The report was authored by the then CRS Eastern Circle P K Acharya, who is now retired. Asked about the probe report and its contents, Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety S K Pathak said: “I will not comment on the matter.” The Commission of Railway Safety functions under the Ministry of Civil Aviation. While the NIA probe is still on — no chargesheet has been filed yet — the final report of the Commissioner of Railway Safety is in. And it identifies a sudden catastrophic mechanical failure as the “probable cause”. The report rules out the possibility of a simple rail fracture on multiple grounds: four trains passed the spot without reporting any abnormality in the track; the drag marks of the derailed coach was not as long as it should have been in a case of rail fracture. When contacted, P K Acharya told The Indian Express: “I said (in the report) that if the NIA finds out that it was a case of sabotage then anything could happen. However, in the event that it finds that there was no sabotage, then these could be the cause. I will not be able to say anything on the report as I have retired.” Our baba CM is awesome (Kamaal ke hai). Neither he knew anything before, nor does he know anything right now. The UP election is for rights of farmers, employment of youth, and development of the state: SP chief Akhilesh Yadav on connection with Ahmedabad blast terrorists Ali Hussain remains quite and answers only when prodded. Diwan is the only one who does the talking. At this point too, Diwan maintains that he is not a Muslim and refuses to reveal his true identity. When the man asks him to produce his Aadhar card, Diwan says he does not have one. Both state that they are residents of Tikaria village in Gonda district, Uttar Pradesh. The man then threatens the youths with the police. He asks them to get into the car and tells them that if they do not speak the truth he will take them to the Kotwali. The then Uttar Pradesh government had appointed Justice MP Saxena of the Allahabad High Court to submit his findings on the incident. In his report submitted towards the end of that year, Justice Saxena informed that there were no pigs in the vicinity of the mosque and that the clash was not caused by the entry of the animal in the Islamic place of prayer. India Today reported that the outbreak of violence was caused by Muslim League (UP) President Shamim Ahmed Khan and two other leaders. Justice Saxena Commission gave a clean chit to PAC and noted that most casualties were caused by stampede rather than police firing. It also absolved the role of any Hindu organisiation, such as the RSS, in instigating the violence. No action was ever taken against the perpetrators, given that the report found Muslim leaders ‘involved’ in engineering the clash. The then DGP (prosecution) Dharamvir Mehta had justified the firing by the cops and the PAC. “I had to be Mr Poison to cure cancer. Desperate maladies need desperate remedies,” he had remarked. Interestingly, his ‘iron hand strategy’ bore fruits as the city did not witness communal violence for several decades after the incident."
