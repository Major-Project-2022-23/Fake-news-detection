       "'Claim= Joe biden announces provision of free meals in every school Text= “Congress should provide free nutritious meals (lunch, breakfast, summer, afterschool meals) for all children in the United States, removing the income test and ensuring all children receive free meals without stigma or burdensome paperwork,” their report states. The Community Eligibility Provision lets high-need schools offer breakfast and lunch to all students at no charge. Any school district, group of schools in a district or schools with 40 percent or more students certified eligible for free school meals can participate in the program. According to reports, Biden wants to take the figure of 40 percent eligibility and change it to 25 percent. The School Nutrition Association, a nonprofit that represents 50,000 school nutrition professionals nationwide, praised Biden’s pledge to increase access to free school meals. “A healthy school meal is integral\\u202fto\\u202fthe school day, and no child should go without due to inability to pay,” said SNA President Lori Adkins, MS, SNS, CHE. “Offering free school meals to all children ensures students are nourished for success.\\u202fResearch\\u202fshows school meals support academic achievement and are the healthiest meals children eat.” The renewed push for free school meals comes as federal waivers that allowed schools to offer free meals to all students during the pandemic expired. Now, schools have returned to charging students for meals if they are not enrolled or qualify for the Free and Reduced-Price meal program. WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Schools across the country could more easily serve free breakfast and lunch to millions of children under a proposed rule change announced Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Under the USDA\\'s Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), schools with 40% or more of their students enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a food assistance program, can receive federal funding to provide free meals without students submitting individual applications. President Joe Biden\\'s administration has committed to ending hunger in the U.S. by 2030. The rule announced Wednesday would lower that threshold from 40% to 25%, expanding the potential reach of the provision to 9 million additional students across 20,000 schools, USDA said. Biden\\'s 2024 budget includes $15 billion over 10 years to support expansion of the provision, USDA said. (Reporting by Leah Douglas; editing by Jonathan Oatis) The plan to expand school meal access\\xa0is part of a strategy unveiled one\\xa0day before the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. With Congress not having acted, some states like California and Maine have begun to create their own universal school meal programs. Even so, most districts are already adjusting to charging some students for meals again this fall while helping parents with children who qualify for free- and reduced-price meals to fill out applications. The White House announced Tuesday that it plans to work with Congress to expand access to free school meals for 9 million more children by 2032 as a first step toward creating a pathway to universal school meals. After the congressional provision expired June 30, an independent Task Force on Hunger, Nutrition and Health composed of professors, advocates and food industry executives was among those advising the White House to bring back universal school meals. Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts If passed, it would provide free school lunch during summer break to 29 million children. Pandemic  food help will continue through the 2021-2022 school year and summer and could go on even longer, as it\\'s tied to the Covid public health emergency declaration In addition, the\\xa0U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in April that all children will receive universal free school lunch through June 30, 2022 due to the pandemic. The latest economic recovery plan from President Joe Biden significantly expands school lunch programs for children. More from\\xa0Invest in You:You can still tap free money for college — here\\'s howHow I learned about investing in stocks - and you can, tooCollege students get career experience as social media brand ambassadors The American Families Plan will also invest $17 billion in the Community Eligibility Provision, a program which allows schools in high-poverty areas to give students free lunch. Before the pandemic, meals were either free, reduced price or full price to students. During the pandemic, the waivers allowed for all meals to be free. The House bill included only free and full-price options. The bill would fully extend all waivers through the summer to allow meal deliveries and grab-and-go options for students. It would also extend supply chain flexibilities and higher than pre-pandemic federal reimbursement rates through the 2022-2023 school year. The school meal waivers allowed for students to grab lunches to-go and or be delivered via school buses. But the biggest omission is the exclusion of flexibilities that suspended eligibility requirements for free and reduced-price meal applications, giving every student free meals. President Joe Biden signed the Keep Kids Fed Act on Saturday morning, extending partial school meal flexibilities through the next school year five days before they were set to expire. WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Schools across the country could more easily serve free breakfast and lunch to millions of children under a proposed rule change announced Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Under the USDA\\'s Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), schools with 40% or more of their students enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a food assistance program, can receive federal funding to provide free meals without students submitting individual applications. That could result in more students accessing free meals with less stigma and schools cutting down on administrative costs, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on a call with reporters Wednesday. About 33,000 schools serving 16 million students currently participate in the CEP, Cindy Long, administrator of USDA\\'s Food and Nutrition Service, said on the call. President Joe Biden\\'s administration has committed to ending hunger in the U.S. by 2030. For next school year, in most school districts, families will need to complete an application through their school to determine if their household is eligible for free or reduced-price school meals, as was done before the pandemic. USDA is also supporting the expansion of direct certification, which uses existing data to certify children for free or reduced-price meals without an additional application. All states are required to directly certify students for free meals if their household receives SNAP benefits, and some states also directly certify for free and reduced-price meals based on participation in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations or Medicaid. States that are interested in participating in the Direct Certification for Medicaid demonstration project are invited to respond to the current request for applications (PDF, 649 KB), which closes on September 30, 2022. In school year 2019-2020, 1.4 million students received free and reduced-price meals thanks to direct certification through Medicaid. The Keep Kids Fed Act will also provide assistance to program operators across the country by: WASHINGTON, June 30, 2022 – The Biden Administration announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will provide nearly $1 billion in additional funding to schools to support the purchase of American-grown foods for their meal programs. The department also applauds the President’s recent signing of the Keep Kids Fed Act, which equips schools, summer meal sites, and child care food programs with extra resources so they can continue serving children through school year 2022-2023. Both actions are a response to the significant challenges child nutrition program operators continue to face, such as high food costs and supply chain disruptions. The $943 million boost from the department is provided through USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation. Funds will be distributed by state agencies to schools across the country, so they can purchase domestically-grown foods for their meal programs. This assistance builds on the $1 billion in Supply Chain Assistance funds USDA previously allocated in December 2021, which states can use this school year as well as next to provide schools with funding for commodity purchases. “USDA is working alongside our child nutrition partners to support them in delivering vital, nutritious meals to tens of millions of children every school day,” said Stacy Dean, deputy undersecretary of food, nutrition, and consumer services. “There’s a long road ahead, but the extra support and funding for our operators will help them continue to serve our children well. We can – and will – overcome these challenges, together.” Baylor suspects most public schools will comply with the new interpretation as they heavily rely on federal funding. He encouraged parents to submit their concerns to the Department of Education, which is expected to issue new Title IX protections soon that could permit transgender individuals to access sex-segregated spaces. \"It is a parent\\'s right to know what their children are doing or what sort of health services or even counseling services are being provided to their children in a school setting,\" Butcher said. The announcement builds on President Joe Biden\\'s Day One Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, which permits transgender students to use male or female bathrooms and play sports with either sex. Biden\\'s executive order drew on the Supreme Court\\'s ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, which altered the meaning of \"sex\" in Title VII to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s Food and Nutrition Service announced in May it will prevent low-income students from participating in its National School Lunch Program if their public school does not adopt the administration\\'s interpretation of Title IX, which holds that the federal civil rights law\\'s provision against discrimination based on sex includes designations of sexual orientation and gender identity. The move was originally reported by\\xa0The Center Square. The Biden administration is requiring schools to comply with its LGBT policies or lose billions in federal funding for school lunches.
