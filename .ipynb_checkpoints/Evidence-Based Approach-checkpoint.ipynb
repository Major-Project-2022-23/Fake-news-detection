Ambedkar was in charge of presenting the details of this bill. It was found that the orthodox Hindu laws were supportive of women's rights since monogamy, divorce and the widow's right to inherit property were present in the Shashtras.[17] Ambedkar recommended the adoption of a uniform civil code.[18][19]  Ambedkar's frequent attack on the caste system and dislike for the upper castes made him unpopular in the parliament. He had done research on the religious texts and considered the caste system in Hindu society to be flawed. According to him, only the Uniform Civil Code bill was this opportunity to reform Hindu society as well to ensure protection to Muslim women who have little protection under Sharia Law.[20] He thus faced severe criticism from the opposition but Nehru later supported Ambedkar's reforms and demand for a Uniform Civil Code.[20] Although a Uniform Civil Code was not introduced at the time, a Hindu Bill was introduced to ensure modern reformation of Hindu Society.\"]]],\n",

       "    \"The Indian Parliament discussed the report of the Hindu law committee during the 1948–1951 and 1951–1954 sessions. The first Prime Minister of the Indian republic, Jawaharlal Nehru, his supporters and women members wanted a uniform civil code to be implemented.[17] As Law Minister, B. R. Ambedkar was in charge of presenting the details of this bill. It was found that the orthodox Hindu laws were supportive of women's rights since monogamy, divorce and the widow's right to inherit property were present in the Shashtras.[17] Ambedkar recommended the adoption of a uniform civil code.[18][19]  Ambedkar's frequent attack on the caste system and dislike for the upper castes made him unpopular in the parliament. He had done research on the religious texts and considered the caste system in Hindu society to be flawed. According to him, only the Uniform Civil Code bill was this opportunity to reform Hindu society as well to ensure protection to Muslim women who have little protection under Sharia Law.[20] He thus faced severe criticism from the opposition but Nehru later supported Ambedkar's reforms and demand for a Uniform Civil Code.[20] Although a Uniform Civil Code was not introduced at the time, a Hindu Bill was introduced to ensure modern reformation of Hindu Society.\"]]]]"
